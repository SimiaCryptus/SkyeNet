The `ChatSocket` class integrates with the `SocketManager` to manage WebSocket sessions and handle incoming and outgoing
messages. It provides mechanisms to connect, receive messages, and close WebSocket sessions. It also interacts with
the `SocketManagerBase` to retrieve user information associated with each session.

### Constructor

```kotlin
ChatSocket(private val sessionState : SocketManager)
```

- **Parameters:**
    - `sessionState`: An instance of `SocketManager` that manages WebSocket sessions and messages.

### Properties

- **user**: Retrieves the user associated with the current WebSocket session.

### Methods

#### onWebSocketConnect(session: Session)

Called when a WebSocket connection is established. It registers the socket with the `SocketManager`, and replays any
messages that need to be sent to the client immediately upon connection.

- **Parameters:**
    - `session`: The `Session` instance representing the established WebSocket connection.

#### onWebSocketText(message: String)

Invoked when a text message is received from the client. It forwards the message to the `SocketManager` for processing.

- **Parameters:**
    - `message`: The text message received from the client.

#### onWebSocketClose(statusCode: Int, reason: String?)

Called when the WebSocket connection is closed. It unregisters the socket from the `SocketManager`.

- **Parameters:**
    - `statusCode`: The status code indicating the reason for closure.
    - `reason`: An optional string providing more detail about the closure reason.

### Companion Object

- **log**: A logger instance for logging debug or error information related to WebSocket connections.

### Usage Example

Below is a hypothetical scenario demonstrating how an instance of `ChatSocket` might be utilized within a chat
application:

```kotlin
// Assuming a server setup that initializes WebSocket endpoints
val socketManager = SocketManager()
val chatSocket = ChatSocket(socketManager)

// The server would typically handle the lifecycle of WebSocket connections automatically,
// invoking onWebSocketConnect, onWebSocketText, and onWebSocketClose as appropriate.
```

### Notes

This class relies heavily on the Jetty WebSocket API and the custom `SocketManager` class for managing WebSocket
sessions and messages. It is designed for use within a chat application, but the principles demonstrated could be
adapted for other types of real-time communication applications.

Remember to handle exceptions and errors gracefully, especially in the `onWebSocketConnect` method when sending replay
messages, to ensure a robust and stable application.

## ChatServer Class Documentation

The `ChatServer` class is an abstract class designed to facilitate the creation and management of a chat server using
Jetty as the underlying web server technology. It provides a structured way to handle WebSocket connections for
real-time messaging, manage sessions, and integrate with authentication and data storage systems.

### Overview

- **Package**: `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.chat`
- **Dependencies**: Requires Jetty server libraries for web and WebSocket support.

### Key Components

#### Properties

- `applicationName`: An abstract property that should be overridden to specify the name of the application.
- `dataStorage`: An open property that can be overridden to provide integration with a data storage interface. It is
  nullable.
- `sessions`: A mutable map that tracks active sessions and their corresponding `SocketManager` instances.

#### Inner Classes

- `WebSocketHandler`: A class that extends `JettyWebSocketServlet` to configure WebSocket behavior and handle incoming
  WebSocket connections. It is responsible for creating `ChatSocket` instances based on session information.

#### Abstract Methods

- `newSession(user: User?, session: Session): SocketManager`: An abstract method that must be implemented to create a
  new `SocketManager` instance for a given user and session. This method is called when a new WebSocket connection is
  established without an existing session.

#### Open Methods

- `configure(webAppContext: WebAppContext)`: An open method that can be overridden to add additional servlets or
  configure the `WebAppContext`. By default, it sets up servlets for handling default requests, WebSocket connections,
  and new session creation.

### Usage

To use the `ChatServer` class, one must create a subclass that implements the abstract properties and methods. Here's a
simplified example:

```kotlin
class MyChatServer(resourceBase: String) : ChatServer(resourceBase) {
  override val applicationName = "MyChatApp"

  override fun newSession(user: User?, session: Session): SocketManager {
    // Implement logic to create and return a SocketManager instance for the new session
  }
}
```

In the subclass, you must provide the application name and implement the `newSession` method to handle session creation.
You may also override the `dataStorage` property if your application requires integration with a storage system.

### Additional Information

- The `WebSocketHandler` inner class is a critical component that manages WebSocket connections. It uses the Jetty
  WebSocket API to configure connection parameters such as timeouts, buffer sizes, and message sizes.
- The `configure` method sets up the necessary servlets for the web application. It is crucial for initializing the chat
  server and ensuring that the WebSocket and session management functionalities are properly registered.

### Conclusion

The `ChatServer` class provides a foundation for building chat applications with WebSocket support in Kotlin using the
Jetty server. By subclassing and implementing the required abstract methods, developers can create customized chat
servers tailored to their specific needs.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\servlet\ApiKeyServlet.kt

## Developer Documentation: ApiKeyServlet

The `ApiKeyServlet` class, part of the `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.servlet` package, is a servlet that manages API
key records. It enables CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on API key records and provides functionality for
inviting users to use an API key.

### Overview

This servlet extends `jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet` and overrides the `doGet` and `doPost` methods to handle HTTP
GET and POST requests, respectively. It interacts with `ApplicationServices` to authenticate users and manage user
settings, API key records, and usage summaries.

The `ApiKeyRecord` data class represents the structure of an API key record, including the owner's email, the API key
itself, a mapped key, a budget, and an optional comment.

### Key Features

- **API Key Management:** Users can create, edit, and delete their API key records.
- **Invitation System:** Users can invite others to use their API key.
- **Usage Summary:** Displays a summary of usage statistics for each API key.

### Endpoints and Operations

#### HTTP GET

- **Edit Record:** `?action=edit&apiKey=<API_KEY>`
    - Displays an edit page for an existing API key record.
- **Delete Record:** `?action=delete&apiKey=<API_KEY>`
    - Deletes an API key record.
- **Create Record:** `?action=create`
    - Displays an edit page with an empty record for creating a new API key record.
- **Invite:** `?action=invite&apiKey=<API_KEY>`
    - Displays a confirmation page for inviting another user to use an API key.
- **Default:** Displays the index page listing all API key records owned by the user.

#### HTTP POST

- **Accept Invite:** `action=acceptInvite&apiKey=<API_KEY>`
    - Accepts an invitation to use an API key.
- **Edit/Create Record:** `action=<ACTION>&apiKey=<API_KEY>&mappedKey=<MAPPED_KEY>&budget=<BUDGET>&comment=<COMMENT>`
    - Updates an existing API key record or creates a new one based on the provided details.

### Usage

#### Authentication

The servlet uses `ApplicationServices.authenticationManager.getUser(req.getCookie())` to authenticate users based on
cookies. Unauthenticated users are not allowed to access or modify API key records.

#### Data Persistence

API key records are stored in a JSON file (`apiKeys.json`) within a directory specified
by `ApplicationServices.dataStorageRoot`. The `saveRecords` method is responsible for serializing the `apiKeyRecords`
list to JSON and saving it to the file.

#### Error Handling

The servlet handles various error conditions, such as unauthorized access, missing or invalid parameters, and attempts
to manipulate records not owned by the user. It responds with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

### Example Usage

To edit an API key record, a user would navigate to `http://<SERVER_ADDRESS>/apiKeys/?action=edit&apiKey=<API_KEY>`,
where `<SERVER_ADDRESS>` is the address of the server hosting the servlet and `<API_KEY>` is the API key to be edited.

### Conclusion

The `ApiKeyServlet` class provides a comprehensive solution for managing API key records within a web application. It
leverages Kotlin's features and integrates with `ApplicationServices` for authentication and data management, offering a
secure and user-friendly interface for API key management.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\servlet\CorsFilter.kt

### CorsFilter Class

The `CorsFilter` class is a servlet filter designed to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for web applications.
This class is part of the `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.servlet` package and ensures that web applications can
securely manage cross-origin requests. It is annotated with `@WebFilter`, making it discoverable by the servlet
container to apply the filter to specified URL patterns.

#### Key Features:

- **Cross-Origin Request Handling:** Adds CORS headers to HTTP responses to allow or restrict resources to be requested
  from another domain.
- **Flexible URL Pattern Matching:** Configured to apply to all URL patterns (`"/*"`) but excludes paths ending
  with `/ws`.
- **Error Logging:** Captures and logs any exceptions thrown during the filtering process.

#### Usage:

1. **Deployment:** The filter is automatically registered and mapped to URL patterns due to the `@WebFilter` annotation.
   It applies to all paths except those ending with `/ws`.
2. **Configuration:** No initial configuration is required in the `init` method, making it straightforward to use.
3. **Exception Handling:** The filter logs exceptions without interrupting the filter chain unless a critical error
   occurs.

#### Methods:

- `init(filterConfig: FilterConfig?)`: Initializes the filter. This implementation does not require any initialization
  logic.
- `doFilter(request: ServletRequest?, response: ServletResponse, chain: FilterChain)`: Applies CORS headers to the HTTP
  response if the request URI does not end with `/ws`. It then proceeds with the filter chain, handling any exceptions
  by logging them and rethrowing.
- `destroy()`: Cleans up any resources if necessary. This implementation does not perform any cleanup actions.

#### CORS Headers Added:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`: Allows all domains to access the resource.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE, PUT`: Specifies the allowed methods for cross-origin
  requests.
- `Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600`: Indicates how long the results of a preflight request can be cached.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, x-requested-with, authorization`: Specifies the headers allowed in the
  actual request.

#### Error Handling:

The filter uses a companion object to obtain a logger instance from SLF4J. It logs any exceptions that occur during the
filtering process under the warning level, ensuring that issues are noted without necessarily halting the application.

#### Example:

```java

@WebFilter(asyncSupported = true, urlPatterns =["/*"])
class CorsFilter :

Filter {
    ...
    override fun doFilter(request:ServletRequest ?, response:ServletResponse, chain:FilterChain){
        ...
        try {
            chain.doFilter(request, response)
        } catch (e:Exception){
            log.warn("Error in filter", e)
            throw e
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how the `CorsFilter` class adds CORS headers to responses for HTTP requests, excluding
those ending with `/ws`, and logs any exceptions encountered during the process.

#### Conclusion:

The `CorsFilter` class provides a simple yet effective way to manage CORS in web applications, ensuring that
cross-origin requests are handled securely and efficiently. Its ease of deployment and configuration makes it a valuable
tool for developers working on web applications that require cross-origin resource sharing.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\servlet\CancelThreadsServlet.kt

## CancelThreadsServlet Documentation

The `CancelThreadsServlet` class is part of the web UI module for managing session-based operations within an
application. It extends `HttpServlet` and is designed to handle HTTP GET and POST requests to cancel threads associated
with a specific session.

### Overview

This servlet allows users to cancel running threads for a given session through a web interface. It provides two main
functionalities:

- **GET Request Handling**: Displays a confirmation form to the user for canceling the session's threads.
- **POST Request Handling**: Processes the cancellation request after user confirmation.

### Dependencies

- **Jakarta Servlet API**: For handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **ApplicationServices**: Provides access to core platform services like authentication and client management.
- **AuthorizationInterface**: For checking user authorization for certain operations.

### Usage

#### GET Request

When a GET request is received, the servlet checks if the request contains a `sessionId` parameter. If not, it responds
with a `400 Bad Request` status and a message indicating that a session ID is required. If a `sessionId` is provided, it
renders an HTML form asking the user to confirm the cancellation by typing 'confirm'.

##### Request Parameters

- **sessionId**: The unique identifier of the session whose threads are to be canceled.

##### Response

- **Content-Type**: `text/html`
- **Status**: `200 OK` (if `sessionId` is provided), `400 Bad Request` (if `sessionId` is missing)

#### POST Request

The POST request handler expects two parameters: `sessionId` and `confirm`. It first checks if the `confirm` parameter
equals 'confirm' (case-insensitive), throwing an exception if not. Then, it validates the presence of `sessionId` and
performs authorization checks to ensure the user is allowed to cancel sessions or global sessions.

If all validations pass, it retrieves the thread pool associated with the session and user, shuts it down immediately,
and interrupts all active threads. Finally, it redirects the user to the root path.

##### Request Parameters

- **sessionId**: The unique identifier of the session whose threads are to be canceled.
- **confirm**: A confirmation input from the user, expected to be 'confirm'.

##### Response

- **Content-Type**: `text/html`
- **Status**: `200 OK` (if the operation is successful), `400 Bad Request` (if parameters are missing or invalid), or
  throws an exception for unauthorized access.

### Security

This servlet implements basic security checks:

- It requires a confirmation input from the user to proceed with the cancellation.
- It performs authorization checks to ensure the user has the necessary permissions to cancel sessions or global
  sessions.

### Example Usage

#### Canceling a Session's Threads

1. A user navigates to the servlet's URL with a `sessionId` parameter in the query string.
2. The servlet responds with an HTML form asking for confirmation.
3. The user types 'confirm' in the form and submits it.
4. The servlet processes the request, cancels the session's threads, and redirects the user to the homepage.

#### Error Handling

- If the user attempts to cancel without the correct `sessionId` or without confirming, the servlet responds with
  appropriate error messages.
- If the user is unauthorized to perform the cancellation, an exception is thrown.

### Conclusion

The `CancelThreadsServlet` provides a web interface for safely and securely canceling threads associated with a specific
session, ensuring that only authorized users can perform such operations and requiring explicit user confirmation to
prevent accidental cancellations.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\servlet\DeleteSessionServlet.kt

## DeleteSessionServlet

The `DeleteSessionServlet` class extends `HttpServlet` and is responsible for handling HTTP GET and POST requests to
delete a user session from the application. It is part of the `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.servlet` package and
utilizes various services and components from the application to perform authorization checks and session deletion.

### Constructor

#### `DeleteSessionServlet(ApplicationServer server)`

Initializes a new instance of the `DeleteSessionServlet` class with the specified `ApplicationServer`.

- **Parameters:**
    - `server`: An instance of `ApplicationServer` that provides access to application-level services such as data
      storage and authentication management.

### Methods

#### `doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)`

Handles the HTTP GET request by displaying an HTML form to the user, allowing them to confirm the deletion of a session.

- **Parameters:**
    - `req`: The `HttpServletRequest` object that contains the request the client made to the servlet.
    - `resp`: The `HttpServletResponse` object that contains the response the servlet returns to the client.
- **Behavior:**
    - Sets the content type of the response to "text/html".
    - Checks if the request contains a "sessionId" parameter. If not, it returns an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status.
    - If a "sessionId" is provided, it displays an HTML form where the user can confirm the deletion of the session by
      typing "confirm".

#### `doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)`

Handles the HTTP POST request to delete a specified session after the user confirms the action.

- **Parameters:**
    - `req`: The `HttpServletRequest` object that contains the request the client made to the servlet.
    - `resp`: The `HttpServletResponse` object that contains the response the servlet sends back to the client.
- **Behavior:**
    - Validates that the "confirm" parameter is present and equals "confirm", case-insensitively. If not, throws an
      exception.
    - Sets the content type of the response to "text/html".
    - Checks if the request contains a "sessionId" parameter. If not, it returns an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status.
    - Retrieves the session and the user from the request.
    - Checks if the user is authorized to delete the session. If the session is global, it also checks if the user has
      public operation authorization.
    - If authorized, it deletes the session using the `dataStorage` service of the `ApplicationServer`.
    - Redirects the user to the home page ("/").

### Usage

This servlet is typically mapped to a URL pattern (e.g., `/delete`) in the web application's deployment descriptor or
through annotations. Users navigate to this URL (or are redirected there) when they wish to delete a session. The
servlet first presents a confirmation form (via `doGet`) and, upon submission, processes the deletion (via `doPost`),
ensuring that only authorized users can delete sessions and that confirmation is received to prevent accidental
deletions.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\servlet\AppInfoServlet.kt

## AppInfoServlet Class Documentation

`AppInfoServlet` is a servlet class designed to serve information about an application in JSON format. It extends

The class uses several imports for its functionality:

- `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.util.JsonUtil`: Utility class for JSON operations, specifically for object serialization.
- `jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet`: Base class for HTTP servlets.
- `jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest`: Interface to provide request information for HTTP servlets.
- `jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse`: Interface to assist in sending a response to an HTTP client.

### Class Declaration

```java
class AppInfoServlet<T>(val info:T) :

HttpServlet()
```

The class is declared with a single generic type parameter `<T>`, allowing it to handle any type of object for
serialization. It has one constructor parameter, `info`, which is the object to be serialized and sent in the HTTP
response.

### Methods

#### `doGet(req: HttpServletRequest, resp: HttpServletResponse)`

This method overrides the `doGet` method from the `HttpServlet` class. It is called by the server (via the service
method) to allow a servlet to handle a GET request.

##### Parameters

- `req: HttpServletRequest`: The HttpServletRequest object that contains the request the client has made of the servlet.
- `resp: HttpServletResponse`: The HttpServletResponse object that contains the response the servlet sends to the
  client.

##### Functionality

1. Sets the content type of the response to `text/json` to indicate that the response will be in JSON format.
2. Sets the HTTP status code of the response to `SC_OK (200)` to indicate that the request has succeeded.
3. Serializes the `info` object into a JSON string using the `JsonUtil.objectMapper().writeValueAsString(info)` method.
4. Writes the serialized JSON string to the response's output stream.

### Example Usage

To use the `AppInfoServlet`, you would typically declare it within your web application's servlet configuration, passing
in the object you wish to serialize and serve. For example:

```kotlin
val appInfo = AppInfo("MyApp", "1.0")
val servlet = AppInfoServlet(appInfo)
```

Here, `AppInfo` would be a data class (or any class) that contains information about your application. The servlet could
then be mapped to a URL pattern via your web application's configuration, making the application info available as a
JSON response at the specified URL.

### Conclusion

The `AppInfoServlet` class provides a simple and flexible way to serve application information or any other data in JSON
format over HTTP. Its generic design allows it to be used with a wide variety of data types, making it a useful utility
in web applications that require dynamic data serialization and transmission.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\servlet\NewSessionServlet.kt

## NewSessionServlet Documentation

The `NewSessionServlet` class is part of the `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.servlet` package and extends
the `HttpServlet` class provided by the Jakarta Servlet API. This servlet is designed to handle HTTP GET requests by
generating a new session ID and returning it to the client. Below is a detailed overview of its implementation and
usage.

### Overview

The `NewSessionServlet` is a simple yet essential component for session management within a web application. It
leverages the `StorageInterface` to generate a globally unique identifier (GUID) that serves as a session ID. This
session ID is then returned to the client as a plain text response. The servlet is designed to be lightweight and
efficient, focusing solely on session creation.

### Implementation Details

- **Package:** `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.servlet`
- **Class:** `NewSessionServlet`
- **Superclass:** `HttpServlet`

#### Key Methods

##### `doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)`

- **Parameters:**
    - `HttpServletRequest req`: The HTTP request object.
    - `HttpServletResponse resp`: The HTTP response object.
- **Operation:** Handles the HTTP GET request by generating a new session ID and returning it to the client.
- **Response Content-Type:** `text/plain`
- **Response Status:** `HttpServletResponse.SC_OK` (HTTP 200)
- **Output:** Writes the generated session ID to the response writer.

### Usage

To utilize the `NewSessionServlet`, it must be properly mapped in the web application's deployment
descriptor (`web.xml`) or through annotations, depending on the servlet's version and configuration. Once mapped, it
listens for HTTP GET requests on its designated path. When a request is received, it generates a new session ID
using `StorageInterface.newGlobalID()`, sets the appropriate response headers, and writes the session ID as a plain text
response to the client.

#### Example Deployment Descriptor Configuration

```xml

<servlet>
    <servlet-name>NewSessionServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.servlet.NewSessionServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>NewSessionServlet</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/newSession</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

#### Security Considerations

While the `NewSessionServlet` serves a fundamental role, it's crucial to consider security implications, such as:

- Ensuring that the session ID generation mechanism (`StorageInterface.newGlobalID()`) produces sufficiently random and
  unpredictable IDs to prevent session guessing attacks.
- Implementing rate limiting or other protective measures to mitigate the risk of abuse, such as session flooding.

### Conclusion

The `NewSessionServlet` provides a straightforward solution for generating new session IDs in a web application. Its
simplicity and reliance on the `StorageInterface` for ID generation ensure that it can be easily integrated and used
within various web projects, contributing to effective session management practices.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\servlet\LogoutServlet.kt

## LogoutServlet Documentation

The `LogoutServlet` class is part of the `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.servlet` package and is responsible for
handling logout requests within the application. This class extends `HttpServlet` and overrides the `doGet` method to
provide functionality for logging out users.

### Overview

When a logout request is received, the servlet performs the following actions:

1. Retrieves the user's cookie.
2. Identifies the user associated with the cookie.
3. If a user is found, logs the user out and redirects to the home page.
4. If no user is associated with the cookie, responds with a bad request status.

### Usage

This servlet is intended to be mapped to a specific URL pattern within the web application's deployment
descriptor (`web.xml`) or through annotations, to handle GET requests for user logout.

### Methods

#### doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)

- **Parameters:**
    - `HttpServletRequest req`: The request object containing the client's request.
    - `HttpServletResponse resp`: The response object for sending data to the client.
- **Functionality:** Handles the GET request by logging out the user. It first attempts to retrieve the user's session
  cookie and then identifies the user associated with this cookie. If a user is found, it proceeds to log out the user
  by calling the `logout` method on the `authenticationManager` and then redirects the user to the home page. If no user
  is associated with the provided cookie, it sets the response status to `HttpServletResponse.SC_BAD_REQUEST`.

### Dependencies

- **ApplicationServices:** Utilizes the `ApplicationServices` class to access the `authenticationManager` for performing
  logout operations.
- **Jakarta Servlet API:** This class extends `HttpServlet` and uses `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse` from
  the Jakarta Servlet API.

### Example

To utilize this servlet, ensure it's properly mapped to handle logout requests. For example, if mapped to `/logout`, a
user can initiate a logout by navigating to `http://yourdomain.com/logout`.

### Logging

The servlet includes a private static logger (`log`) for logging important events or errors. The logger is initialized
using SLF4J.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that the cookie retrieval and user identification process is secure to prevent unauthorized access.
- Consider implementing CSRF protection for logout requests to prevent malicious sites from forcibly logging out users.

### Conclusion

The `LogoutServlet` provides a straightforward mechanism for handling user logout requests within a web application,
leveraging the application's authentication manager to securely manage user sessions.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\servlet\OAuthBase.kt

## OAuthBase Class Documentation

The `OAuthBase` class serves as an abstract foundation for implementing OAuth-based authentication within a web
application. It is part of the `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.servlet` package and utilizes the Eclipse Jetty
server's `WebAppContext` to configure authentication settings.

### Overview

OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for users to grant websites or applications
access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords. This class abstracts the common
logic required to set up OAuth authentication, requiring implementers to define the specifics of their OAuth provider.

### Constructor

#### `OAuthBase(String redirectUri)`

- **Parameters:**
    - `redirectUri`: A `String` specifying the URI to which users will be redirected after authentication. This URI must
      be registered with the OAuth provider.
- **Description**: Constructs an instance of the `OAuthBase` class, initializing it with the provided redirect URI.

### Abstract Method

#### `configure(WebAppContext context, boolean addFilter)`

- **Parameters:**
    - `context`: An instance of `WebAppContext` from the Eclipse Jetty server, representing the web application's
      context.
    - `addFilter`: A `Boolean` indicating whether an authentication filter should be added to the web application. This
      is true by default.
- **Returns**: The modified `WebAppContext` instance, after applying the necessary configurations for OAuth
  authentication.
- **Description**: This method is abstract and must be implemented by subclasses. It is responsible for configuring the
  web application context for OAuth authentication, including setting up any necessary filters or parameters based on
  the specific OAuth provider being used.

### Usage

To use the `OAuthBase` class, one must extend it and implement the `configure` method, providing the logic specific to
the OAuth provider in use. Here is a simplified example:

```java
public class GoogleOAuth extends OAuthBase {

    public GoogleOAuth(String redirectUri) {
        super(redirectUri);
    }

    @Override
    public WebAppContext configure(WebAppContext context, boolean addFilter) {
        // Implementation specific to Google OAuth
        if (addFilter) {
            // Add necessary authentication filters to the context
        }
        // Perform additional configuration as needed
        return context;
    }
}
```

In this example, `GoogleOAuth` extends `OAuthBase`, providing the specifics of configuring a web application context for
Google's OAuth service.

### Conclusion

The `OAuthBase` class abstracts the common aspects of setting up OAuth authentication within a web application, allowing
for easy integration of various OAuth providers by extending and implementing its methods.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\servlet\SessionIdFilter.kt

## SessionIdFilter Documentation

The `SessionIdFilter` class is a custom implementation of the `Filter` interface, designed to provide session-based
authentication for web applications. It is part of the `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.servlet` package. This filter
checks if an incoming HTTP request is secure and, if so, verifies the session ID present in the request's cookies. If
the session ID is missing or invalid, the filter redirects the user to a specified login page.

### Constructor

The `SessionIdFilter` class has a constructor that takes two parameters:

- `isSecure`: A lambda function that determines whether a given `HttpServletRequest` should be considered secure and
  thus subject to session validation. It returns `true` if the request is secure, `false` otherwise.
- `loginRedirect`: A `String` specifying the URL to which the user should be redirected if their session ID is invalid
  or missing.

### Methods

#### `init(filterConfig: FilterConfig?)`

This method is an override from the `Filter` interface and is called by the web container to indicate to a filter that
it is being placed into service. The `SessionIdFilter` implementation of this method is empty, meaning no initialization
action is taken.

#### `doFilter(request: ServletRequest, response: ServletResponse, chain: FilterChain)`

This method implements the core functionality of the `SessionIdFilter`. It checks if the incoming request is
an `HttpServletRequest` and the response is an `HttpServletResponse`. If so, and if the request is determined to be
secure by the `isSecure` lambda, it then checks for a session ID cookie. If a session ID cookie is present, it validates
the session ID by checking if there is a user associated with it through
the `ApplicationServices.authenticationManager.getUser(sessionIdCookie)` method. If the session ID is invalid or
missing, the user is redirected to the `loginRedirect` URL. Otherwise, the filter chain is allowed to proceed by
calling `chain.doFilter(request, response)`.

#### `destroy()`

This method is another override from the `Filter` interface. It is called by the web container to indicate to a filter
that it is being taken out of service. The `SessionIdFilter` implementation of this method is empty, meaning no teardown
action is taken.

### Usage

To use the `SessionIdFilter`, it must be registered and mapped to URL patterns within your web application's `web.xml`
file or programmatically via the Servlet API. When registering the filter, you will need to provide an implementation of
the `isSecure` lambda function and a login redirect URL that fits your application's authentication flow.

This filter is particularly useful in applications where certain resources or paths require the user to be
authenticated, adding an additional layer of security and user management.

### Example

Here is a simple example of how to instantiate and register the `SessionIdFilter`:

```java
FilterRegistration.Dynamic sessionFilter = servletContext.addFilter("SessionIdFilter", new SessionIdFilter(
        request -> request.getRequestURI().startsWith("/secure"), // Example isSecure implementation
        "/login.jsp" // Example login redirect URL
));

sessionFilter.

addMappingForUrlPatterns(EnumSet.of(DispatcherType.REQUEST), true,"/secure/*");
```

In this example, any request to a path starting with `/secure` is considered to need authentication. If the session ID
is not valid, the user is redirected to `login.jsp`.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\servlet\OAuthGoogle.kt

## OAuthGoogle Class Documentation

The `OAuthGoogle` class is designed to facilitate Google OAuth 2.0 authentication for web applications. It integrates
with Google's authentication and authorization services to securely authenticate users and grant access to their Google
services like Gmail, Drive, and Calendar. This class extends the `OAuthBase` class and is tailored for Google's OAuth
2.0 implementation.

### Features

- Supports multiple Google API scopes for accessing a wide range of Google services.
- Provides servlets for handling login and OAuth callback.
- Seamlessly integrates with web applications using the Jetty server.
- Manages user sessions and securely stores authentication credentials.

### Dependencies

- Google API Client Libraries
- Jetty Server
- Jakarta Servlet API
- SLF4J Logging

### Usage

1. **Initialization**: Instantiate the `OAuthGoogle` class by providing the required parameters such as the redirect
   URI, application name, and a function to retrieve the Google client secrets.

2. **Configuration**: Use the `configure` method to add the necessary servlets and filters to your `WebAppContext`. This
   setup is required for handling the authentication flow.

3. **Authentication Flow**: Direct users to the login servlet (`/login` or `/googleLogin`) to initiate the
   authentication process. After authentication, users will be redirected to the specified redirect URI with an
   authorization code, which is then exchanged for an access token.

4. **User Session**: Upon successful authentication, a session cookie is created and sent to the user's browser, which
   is then used for subsequent authenticated requests.

### Key Components

#### Servlets

- **LoginServlet**: Initiates the OAuth flow by redirecting the user to Google's authorization server.
- **CallbackServlet**: Handles the callback from Google's authorization server, exchanges the authorization code for an
  access token, and establishes a user session.

#### Methods

- **configure**: Configures the web application context to include necessary servlets and filters for the authentication
  process.
- **urlDecode**: Utility method for URL decoding.

#### Scopes

A predefined list of scopes is included, covering various Google services like Gmail, Drive, and Calendar. These scopes
determine the level of access the application has to the user's Google services.

### Example

To integrate Google OAuth into a web application:

```kotlin
val googleOAuth = OAuthGoogle(
  redirectUri = "http://yourapplication.com/oauth2callback",
  applicationName = "Your Application Name",
  key = { Thread.currentThread().contextClassLoader.getResourceAsStream("client_secrets.json") }
)

val webAppContext = WebAppContext()
googleOAuth.configure(webAppContext, addFilter = true)
```

### Security Considerations

- Ensure the client secrets are securely stored and not exposed.
- Use HTTPS to protect sensitive information during transmission.
- Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.

### Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Redirect URI**: Ensure the redirect URI provided during initialization matches the one configured in the
  Google Cloud Console.
- **Missing Scopes**: If accessing a Google service fails, verify that the required scope is included in the `scopes`
  list.

### Conclusion

The `OAuthGoogle` class provides a robust solution for integrating Google OAuth 2.0 authentication into web
applications. By following the documentation and adhering to security best practices, developers can securely
authenticate users and access Google services on their behalf.

    2. **User Authentication**: Retrieves the authenticated user based on the cookie provided in the request.
    3. **Session Retrieval**: Fetches a list of sessions associated with the authenticated user from the `dataStorage`.
    4. **HTML Generation**: Dynamically generates HTML content that lists all the user's sessions, including session
       names and creation times. Each session is presented as a clickable row that redirects to a detailed session view,
       prefixed by the provided URL prefix.
    5. **Response Writing**: Writes the generated HTML content to the response writer.

- **HTML Structure**:
    - The generated HTML document includes a `<table>` element where each row represents a session. The table has two
      columns: "Session Name" and "Created", displaying the session's name and creation time, respectively.
    - The document includes minimal styling for readability and interactivity, such as hover effects on table rows.

### Usage Example

This servlet is typically mapped to a specific URL pattern within the web application's servlet context. Once mapped, it
listens for GET requests on that URL, authenticates the user, retrieves their sessions, and displays them in an HTML
table.

```kotlin
val sessionListServlet = SessionListServlet(dataStorage, "/sessions", applicationServer)
servletContext.addServlet("SessionListServlet", sessionListServlet).addMapping("/sessions/list")
```

In this example, the `SessionListServlet` is instantiated with a `dataStorage` instance for session management, a URL
prefix `/sessions` for creating session detail links, and an `applicationServer` instance for additional
functionalities. It is then registered with the servlet context to handle requests to `/sessions/list`.

### Conclusion

The `SessionListServlet` provides a simple yet effective way to display user session information in a web UI, leveraging
Kotlin's string templates and HTML generation capabilities for dynamic content rendering. It showcases the integration
of servlets, session management, and user authentication in a Kotlin-based web application.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\servlet\SessionShareServlet.kt

## SessionShareServlet Developer Documentation

The `SessionShareServlet` class is part of the `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.servlet` package and extends
the `HttpServlet` class to provide functionality for sharing sessions within the Skyenet web application. This servlet
allows users to share their application sessions by generating and providing a URL that can be accessed by others.

### Overview

When a `GET` request is received, the servlet performs several key operations:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: It authenticates the user making the request and checks if they are authorized
   to share sessions.
2. **URL Validation**: Validates the provided URL to ensure it points to a valid session that can be shared.
3. **Session Sharing**: If the session has not been shared before, it generates a unique share ID, saves session
   information, and provides a shareable URL. If the session has already been shared, it reuses the existing share ID
   and URL.
4. **Response Generation**: Generates an HTML response that either provides the shareable URL or indicates an error or
   forbidden access if the user is not authorized.

### Key Methods

#### doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)

This is the main method that handles incoming `GET` requests. It performs the steps outlined in the overview section.

- **Parameters**:
    - `HttpServletRequest req`: The request object containing client request information.
    - `HttpServletResponse resp`: The response object used to send data back to the client.

#### url(String appName, String shareId)

Generates the URL for the shared session based on the application name and share ID.

- **Parameters**:
    - `String appName`: The name of the application whose session is being shared.
    - `String shareId`: The unique identifier for the shared session.
- **Returns**: A `String` representing the URL for the shared session.

#### acceptHost(User user, String host)

Determines if the host from the provided URL is acceptable for sharing based on the user's authorization.

- **Parameters**:
    - `User user`: The user attempting to share the session.
    - `String host`: The host part of the URL being shared.
- **Returns**: `true` if the host is acceptable for sharing; otherwise, `false`.

#### validateUrl(String previousShare)

Validates if the provided URL (associated with a previous share) is still accessible.

- **Parameters**:
    - `String previousShare`: The URL of the previously shared session.
- **Returns**: `true` if the URL is valid and accessible; otherwise, `false`.

### Usage and Examples

To use this servlet, it must be properly mapped in the web application's deployment descriptor (`web.xml`) or through
annotations. Clients can share a session by sending a GET request with the session URL as a parameter. The servlet
authenticates the user, validates the request, and provides a shareable URL if authorized.

### Error Handling

The servlet handles various error scenarios, including:

- Missing or invalid URL parameter.
- Unauthorized access attempts.
- Errors during session sharing or URL generation.

In these cases, the servlet responds with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 403 Forbidden) and
descriptive error messages.

### Security Considerations

- Authentication and authorization checks are critical to prevent unauthorized sharing.
- The acceptHost method ensures that only URLs from trusted hosts can be shared.
- ValidateUrl prevents sharing of sessions that are no longer accessible or valid.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\servlet\ProxyHttpServlet.kt

## ProxyHttpServlet Documentation

The `ProxyHttpServlet` class is designed to act as a reverse proxy, primarily supporting interactions with the OpenAI
API. It extends `HttpServlet` and provides mechanisms for forwarding requests to a specified target URL while handling
authentication, logging, and budget checks.

### Features

- **Flexible Target URL**: The target URL for the proxy is customizable, allowing redirection of requests to any
  specified endpoint.
- **Asynchronous HTTP Client**: Utilizes an asynchronous HTTP client for efficient request handling and forwarding.
- **Request and Response Modification**: Offers hooks for modifying requests before they are forwarded and responses
  before they are returned to the client.
- **Budget Management**: Integrates budget checks to prevent exceeding predefined limits based on API key usage.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging of requests and responses for monitoring and debugging purposes.

### Usage

#### Initialization

The servlet requires a target URL, which is the base URL to which requests will be proxied. This can be specified during
instantiation:

```kotlin
val proxyServlet = ProxyHttpServlet("https://api.openai.com/v1/")
```

#### Asynchronous Client Configuration

The servlet uses a lazily initialized `CloseableHttpAsyncClient` for asynchronous request handling. The client is
configured with:

- A retry strategy with a maximum of 0 retries and a 1-second timeout.
- A request configuration with a 5-minute timeout for connection requests and responses.
- A connection manager supporting up to 1000 simultaneous connections per route and in total.

#### Request Handling

Requests to the servlet are processed by the `service` method, which:

1. Initiates an asynchronous context.
2. Extracts and verifies the API key from the request headers.
3. Checks if the request exceeds the budget associated with the API key.
4. Forwards the request to the target URL if the budget check passes.
5. Modifies the response based on the implementation of `onResponse` before returning it to the client.

#### Request and Response Modification

The `onRequest` and `onResponse` methods can be overridden to modify requests and responses. By default, `onRequest`
returns the request body bytes as-is, and `onResponse` logs the request and response details without modification.

#### Running a Test Server

The companion object includes a `main` method and a `test` function for running a test server with
the `ProxyHttpServlet` and a simple "Hello, World!" servlet. This can be used for local testing and development.

### Example

To run the test server:

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  ProxyHttpServlet.test()
}
```

This starts a Jetty server on port 8080 with the proxy servlet mapped to `/proxy/*` and a test servlet at `/test`.
Accessing `http://localhost:8080/proxy/test` will proxy the request to the test servlet, demonstrating the proxy
functionality.

### Conclusion

The `ProxyHttpServlet` class provides a versatile and efficient means to proxy HTTP requests, with features supporting
request modification, budget management, and detailed logging. Its asynchronous client ensures efficient processing,
making it suitable for scenarios requiring the forwarding of HTTP requests with additional processing and checks.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\servlet\UserInfoServlet.kt

## UserInfoServlet Documentation

The `UserInfoServlet` class extends the `HttpServlet` class to provide a specific implementation for handling HTTP GET
requests. This servlet is designed to return information about the user based on a cookie provided in the request. The
response is formatted in JSON.

### Package

This servlet is part of the `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.servlet` package, which likely contains other servlets and
utilities for web UI interaction within the Skyenet framework.

### Import Statements

The servlet imports various classes for its functionality:

- **com.simiacryptus.jopenai.util.JsonUtil**: Used for converting the `User` object to a JSON string.
- **com.simiacryptus.skyenet.core.platform.ApplicationServices**: Provides access to application-wide services, such as
  authentication.
- **com.simiacryptus.skyenet.core.platform.User**: Represents the user entity.
- **com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.application.ApplicationServer.Companion.getCookie**: Utility method to extract
  cookies from the request.
- **jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse**: Standard servlet API classes for
  handling HTTP requests and responses.

### Class Definition

`class UserInfoServlet : HttpServlet()` - This class is a servlet that handles user information retrieval. It inherits
from `HttpServlet`.

### Methods

#### doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)

This method overrides `HttpServlet`'s `doGet` method to implement the logic for handling HTTP GET requests.

- **Parameters**:
    - `HttpServletRequest req`: The request object, providing information such as parameters and cookies.
    - `HttpServletResponse resp`: The response object, used to send data back to the client.

- **Functionality**:
    1. Sets the content type of the response to `text/json`.
    2. Sets the HTTP status code of the response to `SC_OK` (200).
    3. Attempts to retrieve the user based on a cookie from the request. The method `getCookie()` is used to extract the
       cookie, and `ApplicationServices.authenticationManager.getUser()` is used to retrieve the user.
    4. If a user is found, their information is converted to a JSON string
       using `JsonUtil.objectMapper().writeValueAsString(user)` and written to the response.
    5. If no user is found, an empty JSON object (`{}`) is written to the response.

### Usage

To use this servlet, it must be properly mapped in the web application's configuration (e.g., web.xml or through
annotations) so that it can receive HTTP GET requests. When a request is sent to the servlet's URL with the appropriate
cookie, it will return the user's information in JSON format if the user is authenticated, or an empty JSON object if
not.

This servlet is useful in scenarios where client-side scripts or applications need to fetch information about the
currently authenticated user without requiring a full page reload or additional authentication mechanisms.

### Security Considerations

Ensure that sensitive user information is not exposed unintentionally through this servlet. It's important to consider
what user data is serialized into JSON and sent in the response. Additionally, proper validation and sanitation of
cookies and other inputs should be implemented to prevent security vulnerabilities.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\servlet\SessionThreadsServlet.kt

### SessionThreadsServlet Documentation

The `SessionThreadsServlet` class is part of the web UI component of an application, designed to display detailed
information about thread pools associated with a particular session. It extends the `HttpServlet` class, making it a
servlet that can respond to HTTP GET requests with session-specific thread pool statistics and stack traces.

#### Package

The servlet is located in the `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.servlet` package, which suggests it is part of the web UI
module of the Skyenet application.

#### Dependencies

This class relies on various components from the `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.core.platform` package,
including `ApplicationServices`, `ClientManager`, and `Session`. It also utilizes the `ApplicationServer` class from
the `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.application` package for server-related functionalities.

#### Constructor

The constructor of the `SessionThreadsServlet` class requires an `ApplicationServer` instance. This dependency is
injected at the time of servlet instantiation and is used to access application-level services and configurations.

```java
SessionThreadsServlet(ApplicationServer server)
```

#### doGet Method

The `doGet` method is overridden to handle HTTP GET requests. It is designed to output HTML content that displays thread
pool statistics and stack traces for a given session.

##### Parameters

- `HttpServletRequest req`: The request object, which provides request information for HTTP servlets.
- `HttpServletResponse resp`: The response object, which servlets use to respond to requests.

##### Functionality

1. **Content Type and Status**: Sets the response content type to `text/html` and the status
   to `HttpServletResponse.SC_OK`.

2. **Session ID Check**: Checks if the request contains a `sessionId` parameter. If not, it returns a `400 Bad Request`
   response with a message indicating that a session ID is required.

3. **Session and User Identification**: Creates a `Session` object using the provided `sessionId` and retrieves the
   current user by using a cookie from the request.

4. **Thread Pool Retrieval**: Obtains a thread pool associated with the session and user through the `clientManager`.

5. **HTML Response Generation**: Generates an HTML page displaying statistics about the thread pool (such as active
   thread count, queue size, completed task count, etc.) and the stack traces of all alive threads in the pool. The HTML
   includes CSS styles for better readability.

##### HTML Structure

The response HTML is structured into two main sections:

- **Pool Stats**: Displays general statistics about the thread pool, including session ID, user, pool details, active
  and total thread counts, queue size, completed task count, and total task count.

- **Thread Stacks**: Lists all alive threads in the pool, showing each thread's name and stack trace. Each stack trace
  element is displayed in a monospaced font for clarity.

#### Usage

To deploy this servlet, it needs to be registered in the web application's servlet context, typically defined in
the `web.xml` file or through annotations. Once deployed, it can be accessed by making a GET request to the servlet's
URL with a `sessionId` parameter. This could be useful for administrators or developers for debugging and monitoring
purposes, providing insights into the application's thread usage and potential bottlenecks at the session level.

#### Security Considerations

Given that this servlet exposes sensitive information about the application's internal state, it's crucial to implement
appropriate authentication and authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can access this information.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\servlet\UserSettingsServlet.kt

## UserSettingsServlet Documentation

`UserSettingsServlet` is a servlet class designed to manage user settings within a web application. This class
extends `HttpServlet` and overrides the `doGet` and `doPost` methods to handle HTTP GET and POST requests, respectively.
It is part of the `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.servlet` package.

### Overview

The servlet serves two main purposes:

1. **Display User Settings**: Through the `doGet` method, it presents the user's current settings in an editable form.
2. **Update User Settings**: Through the `doPost` method, it allows users to submit changes to their settings which are
   then persisted.

### Key Components

- **Authentication**: Determines the user's identity based on a cookie.
- **User Settings Management**: Fetches and updates user settings data.
- **Security**: Masks sensitive information like API keys in the user interface.

### Methods

#### doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)

Handles HTTP GET requests by displaying the user's current settings in a web form.

##### Parameters:

- `HttpServletRequest req`: The request object containing the request data.
- `HttpServletResponse resp`: The response object used to send data back to the client.

##### Behavior:

1. Sets the response content type to `text/html`.
2. Fetches user information based on a cookie.
3. If the user is not authenticated, sends a 400 Bad Request response.
4. Otherwise, retrieves the user's settings, masks sensitive information, and renders a form with the settings as
   editable JSON.

#### doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)

Handles HTTP POST requests for updating user settings.

##### Parameters:

- `HttpServletRequest req`: The request object containing the form data.
- `HttpServletResponse resp`: The response object used to send data back to the client.

##### Behavior:

1. Fetches user information based on a cookie.
2. If the user is not authenticated, sends a 400 Bad Request response.
3. Otherwise, parses the updated settings from the request, reconciles them with existing settings (ensuring sensitive
   information like API keys are correctly handled), and updates the user's settings.
4. Redirects the user to the home page.

### Security Considerations

- The servlet masks API keys when displaying them to the user to prevent accidental exposure.
- It uses cookies for authentication, which requires proper cookie security settings (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure attributes)
  to mitigate risks like CSRF or session hijacking.

### Dependencies

- `com.simiacryptus.jopenai.util.JsonUtil`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.core.platform.*`: For application services like authentication and user settings management.
- `jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet`: Base class for handling HTTP requests.

### Usage Example

This servlet is mapped to a URL (e.g., `/userSettings/`) in the web application. Users can view and edit their settings
by navigating to this URL. The servlet ensures that only authenticated users can access and modify their settings.

```java

@WebServlet("/userSettings/")
public class UserSettingsServlet extends HttpServlet {
    // Implementation details...
}
```

**Note**: Actual deployment and URL mapping require additional configuration in the web application (e.g., `web.xml` or
annotations).

### Logging

The servlet includes a static logger for logging important events or errors. This can be utilized for debugging or
monitoring the servlet's operations.

```java
private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(UserSettingsServlet.class);
```

Ensure proper logging levels are set in your logging framework configuration to capture necessary log messages.

### Constructor

#### ZipServlet(StorageInterface dataStorage)

Initializes a new instance of the `ZipServlet` class with a specified `StorageInterface` for accessing file storage.

- **Parameters:**
    - `dataStorage`: An instance of `StorageInterface` used to access the server's file storage system.

### Public Methods

#### doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)

Handles HTTP GET requests by generating and serving a ZIP archive based on parameters provided in the request.

- **Parameters:**
    - `req`: An `HttpServletRequest` object that contains the request the client has made to the servlet.
    - `resp`: An `HttpServletResponse` object that contains the response the servlet sends to the client.
- **Throws:** This method does not explicitly throw exceptions, but underlying operations may throw runtime exceptions
  such as `IOException`.

### Private Methods

#### write(File basePath, File file, ZipOutputStream zip)

Recursively writes files and directories into the provided `ZipOutputStream`. If the provided `File` object is a
directory, this method will recursively call itself for each file within the directory, excluding files starting
with ".".

- **Parameters:**
    - `basePath`: The base path used to calculate relative paths for ZIP entries.
    - `file`: The file or directory to be written to the ZIP archive.
    - `zip`: The `ZipOutputStream` to which files and directories are written.
- **Visibility:** Private. This method is an implementation detail and not intended for external use.

### Usage Example

This class is typically used as part of a web application to dynamically generate ZIP archives of files stored on the
server. It is intended to be mapped to a specific URL pattern within a web application's servlet configuration.

```java

@WebServlet("/zip")
public class ZipServlet extends HttpServlet {
    private StorageInterface dataStorage;

    public ZipServlet() {
        this.dataStorage = /* Initialize your StorageInterface implementation here */;
    }

    // Implementation of doGet and other methods
}
```

### Important Considerations

- The servlet performs basic path validation but does not implement comprehensive security checks. Ensure that proper
  authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to prevent unauthorized access to files.
- Large files or directories may consume significant server resources during the zipping process. Consider implementing
  size limits or asynchronous processing to mitigate resource exhaustion.
- Temporary files are created during the zipping process and are deleted after serving. Ensure that the server has
  sufficient disk space and permissions to manage these temporary files.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `ZipServlet` class, its functionality, and usage within a
web application context.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\session\MutableSessionHandler.kt

## MutableSessionHandler Class Documentation

The `MutableSessionHandler` class, part of the `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.session` package, is a flexible WebSocket
session manager designed to handle dynamic delegation of socket management tasks. It extends the `SocketManager`
interface, allowing it to manage WebSocket sessions and delegate these tasks to other `SocketManager` instances as
needed.

### Overview

The `MutableSessionHandler` is designed to manage WebSocket connections dynamically. It allows changing the
delegate `SocketManager` at runtime, effectively changing the behavior of how WebSocket messages are handled, sockets
are added or removed, and session replays are obtained. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the handling
logic needs to change based on runtime conditions or configurations.

### Constructor

- `MutableSessionHandler(initialDelegate: SocketManager?)`:
  Initializes a new instance of `MutableSessionHandler` with an optional initial delegate.

### Properties

- `private var priorDelegates: MutableList<SocketManager>`: A list to keep track of all previous delegates.
- `private var currentDelegate: SocketManager?`: The current delegate that is actively managing the WebSocket sessions.
- `private val sockets: MutableMap<ChatSocket, Session>`: A map that keeps track of the active WebSocket sessions.

### Methods

#### setDelegate

```kotlin
fun setDelegate(delegate: SocketManager)
```

Sets a new delegate for managing WebSocket sessions. The current delegate, if any, is added to the list of prior
delegates, and the new delegate takes over. All existing WebSocket sessions are transferred to the new delegate.

#### removeSocket

```kotlin
override fun removeSocket(socket: ChatSocket)
```

Removes a WebSocket session. The session is removed from the internal map and also from the current delegate, if any.

#### addSocket

```kotlin
override fun addSocket(socket: ChatSocket, session: Session)
```

Adds a new WebSocket session. The session is added to the internal map and also to the current delegate, if any.

#### getReplay

```kotlin
override fun getReplay(): List<String>
```

Returns a list of messages that represent the replay of all sessions managed by this handler. This includes replays from
all prior delegates as well as the current delegate.

#### onWebSocketText

```kotlin
override fun onWebSocketText(socket: ChatSocket, message: String)
```

Handles an incoming text message on a WebSocket. This method delegates the handling of the message to the current
delegate, if any.

### Usage Example

```kotlin
val mutableSessionHandler = MutableSessionHandler(initialDelegate)
mutableSessionHandler.addSocket(chatSocket, session)
mutableSessionHandler.setDelegate(newDelegate)
```

This example demonstrates creating a `MutableSessionHandler` with an initial delegate, adding a WebSocket session, and
then changing the delegate.

### Conclusion

The `MutableSessionHandler` class provides a flexible and dynamic way to manage WebSocket sessions in applications where
the handling logic needs to adapt at runtime. Its ability to switch delegates on-the-fly and keep track of session
replays makes it a powerful tool for complex WebSocket management scenarios.

data to a specified location on the disk. This utility is part of the `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.util` package and
leverages the `ApplicationServices` for encryption services. It is a Kotlin-based utility that provides a
straightforward approach to encrypting strings (file contents) and saving them for further use.

### Prerequisites

Before using the `EncryptFiles` utility, ensure that you have the following prerequisites met:

- AWS Account: You need an AWS account and access to the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to create and manage
  encryption keys.
- AWS Credentials: Your AWS credentials must be configured properly on the machine where you intend to run this utility.
  This is often done via the AWS CLI configuration or by setting environment variables.
- Kotlin Environment: Since this utility is written in Kotlin, ensure that you have a Kotlin compiler installed or an
  IDE that supports Kotlin (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).

### Usage

The `EncryptFiles` utility is designed to be executed from the command line or within an IDE. Here's a brief guide on
how to use it:

1. **Prepare the Input String**: The utility is currently set up to encrypt a hardcoded empty string `""`. You will need
   to modify the input string within the `main` function to the content you wish to encrypt.

2. **Set the Key ID**: Replace the placeholder key
   ID (`"arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:470240306861:key/a1340b89-64e6-480c-a44c-e7bc0c70dcb1"`) with your actual AWS KMS key ARN
   that you intend to use for encryption.

3. **Specify the Output Path**: Change the output
   path (`"""C:\Users\andre\code\SkyenetApps\src\main\resources\patreon.json.kms"""`) to the desired location on your
   disk where the encrypted file should be saved.

4. **Run the Utility**: Execute the utility from your command line or IDE. The specified string will be encrypted using
   the provided AWS KMS key and written to the specified output path.

### Extension Methods

The utility includes two extension methods for the `String` class:

- `encrypt(keyId: String)`: Encrypts the string (interpreted as file content) using the specified AWS KMS key ID. Throws
  a `RuntimeException` if encryption fails.

- `write(outpath: String)`: Writes the string (interpreted as file content) to the specified path on the disk.

### Error Handling

The utility throws a `RuntimeException` if encryption fails, ensuring that you are alerted to issues during the
encryption process. Ensure to catch this exception appropriately when using this utility in a larger application.

### Security Considerations

- **Key Management**: Always follow best practices for managing your AWS KMS keys. Limit access to those keys to only
  the necessary personnel and applications.

- **Sensitive Data**: Be cautious about the data you choose to encrypt and where you save the encrypted files. Ensure
  that the output path is secure and accessible only to authorized users.

### Conclusion

The `EncryptFiles` utility provides a simple yet powerful way to encrypt data using AWS KMS and save it locally. By
modifying the utility to suit your needs, you can easily incorporate file encryption into your applications or
workflows.

# main\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\util\OpenAPI.kt

## Developer Documentation: OpenAPI Model and Serialization

This document provides an overview and usage guide for the OpenAPI model classes and serialization/deserialization
functions defined in the Kotlin package `com.simiacryptus.skyenet.webui.util`. These classes and functions are designed
to facilitate the creation, manipulation, and conversion of OpenAPI specifications within Kotlin applications.

### Overview

The OpenAPI model classes represent the structure of an OpenAPI specification, which is a standard, language-agnostic
interface to RESTful APIs. The model includes classes for the OpenAPI root document, API metadata, paths, operations,
responses, and various components that can be reused throughout the specification.

#### Key Classes

- `OpenAPI`: Represents the root document of an OpenAPI specification.
- `Info`: Contains metadata about the API, such as title, version, and contact information.
- `PathItem`: Represents an API endpoint and its available operations (GET, POST, etc.).
- `Operation`: Describes a single API operation on a path.
- `Response`: Represents a response from an API operation.
- `Components`: Holds reusable components for the OpenAPI specification, like schemas and parameters.
- `Schema`, `Parameter`, `RequestBody`, etc.: Represent specific components that can be reused in the API specification.

#### Serialization and Deserialization

Two utility functions are provided for converting between OpenAPI model instances and their JSON representations:

- `serializeOpenApiSpec(openApi: OpenAPI): String`: Converts an `OpenAPI` object into a JSON string.
- `deserializeOpenApiSpec(json: String): OpenAPI`: Parses a JSON string to produce an `OpenAPI` object.

### Usage

#### Creating an OpenAPI Specification

To create an OpenAPI specification, instantiate `OpenAPI` and related classes as needed, filling in properties to
describe your API:

```kotlin
val apiSpec = OpenAPI(
  info = Info(
    title = "Example API",
    version = "1.0.0",
    description = "This is a sample API"
  ),
  paths = mapOf(
    "/example" to PathItem(
      get = Operation(
        summary = "Get example",
        responses = mapOf(
          "200" to Response(description = "Success")
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
```

#### Merging OpenAPI Specifications

OpenAPI objects can be merged together, allowing for modular construction of API specifications:

```kotlin
val baseSpec = OpenAPI(...)
val extensionSpec = OpenAPI(...)
val mergedSpec = baseSpec.merge(extensionSpec)
```

#### Serialization

To convert an `OpenAPI` instance to a JSON string for storage or transmission:

```kotlin
val jsonSpec = serializeOpenApiSpec(apiSpec)
```

#### Deserialization

To load an OpenAPI specification from a JSON string:

```kotlin
val apiSpec = deserializeOpenApiSpec(jsonSpec)
```

### Conclusion

The OpenAPI model classes and serialization functions provide a Kotlin-friendly way to work with OpenAPI specifications.
By leveraging these tools, developers can programmatically create, modify, and share API definitions in a structured and
standardized format.

#### connect(sessionId, customReceiveFunction)

Initiates a WebSocket connection with the server using a provided session ID. It constructs the WebSocket URL
dynamically based on the current page location and the session ID. This function also sets up event listeners
for `open`, `message`, `close`, and `error` events on the WebSocket. Optionally, a custom function can be provided to
handle incoming messages (`customReceiveFunction`).

##### Parameters

- **sessionId** (String): The session ID to be used for the WebSocket connection.
- **customReceiveFunction** (Function) (optional): A custom function to handle incoming WebSocket messages. If not
  provided, a default handler (`onWebSocketText`) is used.

##### Usage

```javascript
connect(sessionId, (event) => {
    console.log("Received message:", event.data);
});
```

#### showDisconnectedOverlay(show)

Controls the visibility of UI elements (e.g., overlays or disabled controls) based on the WebSocket connection status.
It is used internally to disable or enable UI controls when the WebSocket connection is closed or opened, respectively.

##### Parameters

- **show** (Boolean): Determines whether to show or hide the disconnected overlay. `true` to show (or disable
  controls), `false` to hide (or enable controls).

##### Usage

```javascript
// To disable controls
showDisconnectedOverlay(true);

// To enable controls
showDisconnectedOverlay(false);
```

### Example Workflow

1. **Start**: Call `getSessionId()` to retrieve or generate a session ID and establish a WebSocket connection.
2. **Send Messages**: Use `send(message)` to send messages through the WebSocket.
3. **Receive Messages**: Handle incoming messages using the custom function provided to `connect(...)`.
4. **Connection Status**: Use `showDisconnectedOverlay(show)` to manage UI elements based on the connection status.

This module provides a comprehensive solution for managing WebSocket communications, including session management,
message sending and receiving, and UI control based on connection status.

#### Developer Documentation: Importing Shared Styles in SASS

This document provides a guide on how to import shared styles into your SASS project, using specific examples from a
project structure. The focus is on importing styles from a `forest` theme and a main stylesheet located within a shared
directory.

##### Overview

To maintain consistency and reusability across a large project, it's common to have shared styles, themes, or utility
classes. These shared resources can be imported into individual SASS files to apply a cohesive look and feel or to reuse
common styles without duplication.

##### File Structure

For the purpose of this documentation, consider the following simplified project structure:

```
project-directory/
│
├── styles/
│   └── your-stylesheet.scss
│
└── shared/
    ├── schemes/
    │   └── forest.scss
    └── main.scss
```

- `forest.scss` contains specific theme styles for a forest-themed UI.
- `main.scss` includes global styles, variables, mixins, or functions used across the project.

##### Importing Shared Styles

To import these shared styles into your SASS file (e.g., `your-stylesheet.scss`), follow the steps below:

1. **Navigate to Your Stylesheet**: Open the SASS file where you want to import the shared styles. This file is
   typically part of your project's specific module or component.

2. **Use the `@import` Directive**: At the top of your file, use the `@import` directive to include the shared styles.
   The path provided should be relative to the location of the file you're editing.

   Example imports:
    ```scss
    @import '../shared/schemes/forest';
    @import '../shared/main';
    ```

    - The first line imports the `forest` theme styles.
    - The second line imports the global styles defined in `main.scss`.

##### Relative Paths

The `@import` directive requires a path to the file you want to import. In our examples, the `..` notation moves up one
directory level from the current file's location, allowing access to the `shared` directory. Adjust the path as
necessary based on your project's directory structure.

##### Best Practices

- **Order of Imports**: Import global styles (`main.scss`) before theme-specific styles (`forest.scss`) to ensure that
  theme styles can override global defaults if needed.
- **Minimal Imports**: Only import the necessary files to keep the compiled CSS size minimal. Avoid importing entire
  libraries if you only need a small subset of their functionality.
- **Use of Variables and Mixins**: Leverage variables and mixins defined in `main.scss` throughout your stylesheets to
  maintain consistency and simplify maintenance.

##### Conclusion

Importing shared styles in SASS is a straightforward but powerful feature to organize and maintain styles across a large
project. By following the outlined steps and best practices, you can ensure a consistent and efficient styling process.

#### Developer Documentation for SVG Graphic

This SVG graphic is a complex illustration composed of multiple paths, styles, and colors. It is designed to be used in
web applications, digital media, or any platform that supports SVG format. Below is a detailed documentation intended
for developers who wish to integrate or modify this SVG graphic in their projects.

##### Overview

The SVG graphic is an intricate design, primarily composed of various shapes and colors, making it suitable for a wide
range of applications, from website decorations to digital art projects. It utilizes a combination of filled paths and
strokes to create a detailed illustration.

##### File Information

- **File Format:** SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- **Encoding:** UTF-8
- **SVG Version:** 1.1

##### Implementation Guide

1. **Integration:**

   To integrate the SVG graphic into an HTML document, use the following tag:

   ```html
   <img src="path/to/svgfile.svg" alt="Description of the Graphic">
   ```

   Alternatively, you can directly embed the SVG code into your HTML file to further manipulate the SVG properties:

   ```html
   <!-- Paste the SVG code here -->
   ```

2. **Styling:**

   The SVG graphic comes with predefined styles within the `<style>` tag. If you wish to customize the appearance, you
   can override these styles in your CSS file or within the `<style>` tag itself.

   Example of overriding styles:

   ```css
   .st0 { fill: #newColor; }
   ```

3. **Scaling:**

   Being a vector graphic, it can be scaled to any size without loss of quality. To resize the SVG, you can modify
   the `width` and `height` attributes in the `<svg>` tag or through CSS.

   Example:

   ```html
   <svg version="1.1" width="200px" height="200px">
   ```

   Or using CSS:

   ```css
   svg { width: 200px; height: 200px; }
   ```

4. **Animation:**

   SVG elements can be animated using CSS animations or SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language). For simple
   animations like hover effects, CSS is recommended.

   Example of a CSS hover effect:

   ```css
   .st0:hover { fill: #anotherColor; }
   ```

5. **Accessibility:**

   Ensure accessibility by providing descriptive titles and descriptions using the `<title>` and `<desc>` tags within
   the SVG. Additionally, when using the `<img>` tag to embed the SVG, always include an `alt` attribute.

   Example:

   ```html
   <svg>
     <title>Descriptive Title</title>
     <desc>Description of the graphic.</desc>
     ...
   </svg>
   ```

##### Optimization

For optimal performance, especially for web use, consider minimizing the SVG code. Tools like SVGO can help reduce file
size by removing unnecessary metadata, comments, and other redundant information without affecting the visual output.

##### Browser Support

SVG is supported across all modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 9 and
above. However, complex SVG graphics with filters and animations might have varying performance across different devices
and browsers. Always test your SVG graphics across multiple platforms for compatibility.

- `@import '../shared/schemes/night';`
    - This line imports the "night" theme style definitions from a relative path. The `'../'` indicates that the file is
      located one directory up from the current directory, then inside the `shared/schemes` directory. This allows you
      to apply the night theme's color schemes, fonts, and other style properties to your current stylesheet.

- `@import '../shared/main';`
    - This line imports the main stylesheet from a relative path, similar to the first import statement. The `main` file
      is likely to contain global styles that are applicable across different parts of the application, such as reset
      styles, base typography, and utility classes.

#### Best Practices

- **Organize Shared Styles:** Keep shared styles, such as themes or utility classes, in a separate directory. This makes
  them easy to locate and import as needed.
- **Use Descriptive Names:** Name your style files descriptively to make it clear what they contain. For
  example, `night.scss` for a night theme.
- **Minimize Dependencies:** While sharing styles is beneficial, minimize the number of dependencies each file has to
  keep the styles modular and easy to maintain.
- **Use Version Control:** Keep your shared styles in a version control system. This allows you to track changes and
  roll back if necessary.

#### Conclusion

Importing shared styles is a powerful way to ensure consistency and reduce redundancy in your web development projects.
By organizing your styles into shared files and importing them where needed, you can streamline your development process
and make your styles easier to manage and update.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SCSS allows the use of variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, making it a
powerful tool for writing efficient and maintainable stylesheets.

##### Importing Stylesheets

The `@import` rule in SCSS is used to import external stylesheets into the current stylesheet. This rule enables
developers to modularize their CSS by dividing it into smaller, maintainable pieces.

###### Syntax:

```scss
@import 'path/to/stylesheet';
```

- The path to the stylesheet can be relative or absolute.
- The file extension `.scss` is optional and can be omitted.

##### Specifics of the Provided Code

1. **Normal Scheme Stylesheet:**

    - `@import '../shared/schemes/normal';`
    - This line imports the stylesheet for the "normal" theme or scheme from the shared schemes directory. It's useful
      for applying a consistent look and feel across various components or pages that require this specific styling
      scheme.

2. **Main Shared Stylesheet:**

    - `@import '../shared/main';`
    - This line imports the main shared stylesheet, which likely contains common styles, variables, mixins, or functions
      that are used across the entire project. This ensures that all components or pages have access to these
      foundational styles, promoting uniformity and reducing code duplication.

##### Best Practices

- **Modularization:** Keep your stylesheets modular by separating them into logical groups (e.g., base, components,
  layouts, themes). This makes it easier to manage and understand the styles in your project.
- **Use Descriptive Names:** Choose clear and descriptive names for your stylesheet files to make it easier for other
  developers to understand what each file contains at a glance.
- **Relative Paths:** Use relative paths for importing styles to ensure portability and flexibility of your project
  structure.

# main\resources\application\pony.scss

The provided code snippet demonstrates how to import resources from other files into the current stylesheet file. This
is a common practice in web development where modular CSS is used to organize and maintain styles across a large
project. Below is a detailed explanation of the code snippet provided:

```scss
@import '../shared/schemes/pony';
@import '../shared/main';
```

#### Overview

This code snippet is written in SCSS, a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS). SCSS provides mechanisms like variables, nesting, and imports which help in writing more
maintainable and concise CSS code.

#### Import Directives

The `@import` directive is used to include the content of one file into another. This is particularly useful for
splitting your CSS into smaller, more manageable segments. When the SCSS file is processed, it takes the file(s) you’ve
included with `@import` and combines them with the file you’re working on to produce a single CSS output.

##### Syntax

```scss
@import 'path/to/file';
```

- The path to the file can be relative or absolute.
- The file extension `.scss` is optional and can be omitted.

##### Examples

1. Importing a Scheme File:

```scss
@import '../shared/schemes/pony';
```

This line imports a scheme file named `pony.scss` from a directory named `schemes` within a `shared` directory, which is
a sibling of the current directory (indicated by `..`).

2. Importing a Main Stylesheet:

```scss
@import '../shared/main';
```

This imports a main stylesheet named `main.scss` from a `shared` directory that is a sibling of the current directory.

#### Best Practices

- **Modularization:** Use `@import` to break down your styles into smaller, more manageable pieces. This improves
  readability and maintainability.
- **Order of Import:** The order in which you import files matters. Files are imported and processed in the order they
  appear. This means styles in later files can override those in earlier files.
- **Avoid Excessive Nesting:** While splitting your CSS into smaller files, be mindful of creating too deep a directory
  structure. It can make managing and locating files more challenging.
- **Limitation:** Each `@import` statement results in an HTTP request (in plain CSS). However, in SCSS, all imports are
  combined into a single CSS file during the compilation process, mitigating this issue.

#### Conclusion

The `@import` directive in SCSS is a powerful feature for organizing and managing stylesheets in a web development
project. By separating styles into different files and importing them as needed, developers can maintain cleaner and
more modular codebases.

#### Developer Documentation for App Type Styles

This documentation outlines the CSS styles applied to elements with the class `.app-type` within our application. The
purpose of these styles is to create a consistent appearance for specific text elements that are meant to stand out with
a distinctive look, often used to label or categorize content within the app.

##### Style Imports

Before diving into the `.app-type` class, it's important to note the external style dependencies:

- `@import '../shared/schemes/forest';` - This line imports color schemes, fonts, or other styling elements from a
  shared directory named `forest`. This import suggests that the `.app-type` class may indirectly utilize styles or
  variables defined within the `forest` scheme.

- `@import '../shared/main';` - This import statement includes the main stylesheet from the shared directory. It likely
  contains global styles, variables, or mixins that are essential across the application, which the `.app-type` class
  might also utilize.

##### `.app-type` Class Styles

The `.app-type` class is designed to modify the appearance of text elements to which it is applied. Below is a breakdown
of each style property and its purpose:

- `text-transform: uppercase;` - Converts the text to uppercase, making it stand out and ensuring uniformity in the
  visual presentation.

- `font-size: 0.6em;` - Sets the font size to 0.6 times the size of the font of its parent element. This smaller font
  size helps differentiate the `.app-type` text from regular content text.

- `font-weight: 600;` - Applies a font weight of 600, making the text semi-bold. This increases readability and draws
  attention to the text.

- `background-color: rgba(0, 200, 255, 0.25);` - Assigns a background color with a low opacity to the element. The color
  used is a shade of light blue (`rgba(0, 200, 255, 0.25)`), providing a subtle highlight without overwhelming the text
  color.

- `border-radius: 5px;` - Rounds the corners of the element's border with a radius of 5 pixels, giving it a modern,
  pill-like shape.

- `padding: 2px 5px;` - Adds padding inside the element, with 2 pixels on the top and bottom and 5 pixels on the left
  and right. This creates space around the text, improving legibility and aesthetic appeal.

- `color: white;` - Sets the text color to white, ensuring high contrast against the semi-transparent light blue
  background, which aids in readability.

##### Summary

The `.app-type` class is a crucial part of our application's styling, designed to visually distinguish certain text
elements from the rest of the content. By applying these styles, developers can ensure that specific labels or
categories within the app are consistently formatted, enhancing the user interface's overall look and feel.

### Developer Documentation for SVG Graphic

This SVG graphic is a complex illustration composed of multiple paths, styles, and colors. It's designed for web
developers and graphic designers who need to integrate vector-based images into their projects, particularly for web
pages or any application that supports SVG format.

#### Overview

The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format is an XML-based file format for describing two-dimensional vector graphics.
This SVG graphic is defined with various elements and attributes that specify the shapes, colors, and paths within the
image.

#### Key Components

- **Paths (`<path>`):** The core elements of the SVG, defining the shapes and outlines. Each path element comes with
  a `d` attribute containing the drawing instructions.
- **Styles (`<style>`):** CSS styles defined within the SVG to style the paths. This includes fill colors, stroke
  widths, and more.
- **Groups (`<g>`):** Elements can be grouped together with the `<g>` element for easier styling or transformations as a
  single unit.

#### Integration

To integrate this SVG into a web page, you can directly embed the SVG code into your HTML document. Alternatively, you
can save the SVG code in an `.svg` file and reference it with an `<img>` tag, CSS `background-image`, or
the `<object>`, `<embed>`, or `<iframe>` tags for more complex interactions.

##### Embedding Directly in HTML

```html
<!-- Direct embedding of SVG code -->
<div class="svg-container">
    <!-- SVG code goes here -->
</div>
```

##### Referencing External SVG File

```html
<!-- Using <img> tag -->
<img src="path/to/your/svgfile.svg" alt="Description of the image">

<!-- As a background image in CSS -->
<style>
    .svg-background {
        background-image: url('path/to/your/svgfile.svg');
    }
</style>
<div class="svg-background"></div>

<!-- Using <object>, <embed>, or <iframe> -->
<object data="path/to/your/svgfile.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
```

#### Manipulation and Styling

SVGs can be styled and manipulated using CSS and JavaScript, respectively. For instance, to change the fill color of a
path with a class `st0`, you can use:

```css
.st0 {
    fill: #FF0000; /* Changes the fill color to red */
}
```

Using JavaScript, you can add interactivity or dynamic changes to the SVG:

```javascript
document.querySelector('.st0').addEventListener('click', function () {
    this.style.fill = '#00FF00'; // Changes the fill color to green on click
});
```

#### Performance Considerations

While SVGs are excellent for scalability and resolution independence, it's essential to keep the file size in check for
web use, especially for complex graphics. Optimize SVGs using tools like SVGO to remove unnecessary code and reduce file
size without affecting the visual quality.

#### Conclusion

This SVG graphic provides a scalable and customizable way to incorporate high-quality illustrations into your digital
projects. By understanding the structure and integration methods, developers and designers can effectively leverage SVGs
to enhance their applications' visual appeal and user experience.

## Developer Documentation: SCSS Mixins and Styles

This documentation outlines the SCSS mixins and styles used to create a cohesive and maintainable stylesheet for a web
application. The SCSS code provided defines a set of mixins for common CSS patterns, applies these mixins throughout the
stylesheet, and establishes a consistent theming approach using variables for colors, fonts, and other properties.

### SCSS Mixins

#### Typography Mixin

```scss
@mixin typography($font-family: $font-family-primary, $font-size: $font-size-base, $font-weight: $font-weight-normal) {
  font-family: $font-family;
  font-size: $font-size;
  font-weight: $font-weight;
}
```

This mixin allows for easy application of font styles, including family, size, and weight. Default values are set but
can be overridden when the mixin is included.

#### Flex Container Mixin

```scss
@mixin flex-container($direction: column) {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: $direction;
}
```

Simplifies the creation of flex containers, with an optional direction parameter that defaults to `column`.

#### Fixed Full Mixin

```scss
@mixin fixed-full {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100%;
}
```

Applies a fixed, full-screen layout to an element, useful for overlays and modals.

#### Link Hover Transition Mixin

```scss
@mixin link-hover-transition {
  transition: color $transition-speed;
  &:hover {
    color: $link-hover-color;
  }
}
```

Facilitates a smooth color transition on hover for link elements, leveraging a variable for transition speed.

#### Message Style Mixin

```scss
@mixin message-style {
  padding: 10px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  border-radius: $border-radius;
}
```

Provides a consistent styling base for message elements, including padding, margin, and border-radius.

### Usage Examples

#### Applying a Mixin to an Element

```scss
body {
  @include typography($font-family-secondary);
  color: $primary-text-color;
  background-color: $primary-bg-color;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 30px 0 50px;
}
```

This example shows how to include the `typography` mixin with a custom font family for the `<body>` element, along with
additional styles.

#### Flex Container with Row Direction

```scss

#
#main-input,
.reply-form,
.code-execution {
  @include flex-container(row);
  padding: 5px;
  width: -webkit-fill-available;
  background-color: $primary-bg-color;
}
```

Demonstrates the use of the `flex-container` mixin with a `row` direction for layout alignment.

### Keyframes and Animations

Animations are defined using `@keyframes` for specific UI effects:

#### Bounce Animation

```scss
@keyframes bounce {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateY(-10px);
  }
}
```

#### Spin Animation

```scss
@keyframes spin {
  0% {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  100% {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}
```

These keyframes are used to create dynamic visual effects, such as a bouncing or spinning animation, and can be applied
to any element via the `animation` property.

### Conclusion

This documentation provides an overview of the SCSS mixins and styles used within the web application. By utilizing
mixins, variables, and consistent styling practices, the stylesheet remains maintainable and scalable. Remember to
replace the variable values with your project's specific design tokens and adjust the mixins as needed to fit your
application's requirements.

## Developer Documentation

### Overview

This script is designed to enhance user interaction within a web application by managing modal windows, fetching and
displaying user information, and handling theme changes dynamically. It leverages asynchronous JavaScript to fetch data
and modify the DOM in response to user actions.

#### Functions

##### `showModal(endpoint)`

Opens a modal window and fetches content from a specified endpoint to display within the modal.

- **Parameters**
    - `endpoint`: A string representing the URL from which to fetch content to be displayed in the modal.

##### `closeModal()`

Closes the modal window by setting its display style to 'none'.

##### `fetchData(endpoint)`

Fetches data asynchronously from a specified endpoint and displays it within the modal content area. It also handles
loading states and errors.

- **Parameters**
    - `endpoint`: A string representing the URL from which to fetch content.

##### Event Listeners

Sets up various event listeners once the DOM content is fully loaded, handling:

- Closing the modal when the close button or area outside the modal is clicked.
- Fetching and displaying user information.
- Handling theme changes based on user selection.

#### Usage

##### Modal Functionality

To open a modal with content fetched from a specific endpoint, call `showModal('/your-endpoint')`. To close the modal,
either call `closeModal()` directly, click the close button, or click outside the modal area.

##### Fetching User Information

Upon page load, the script automatically fetches user information from the 'userInfo' endpoint. If the user is logged
in (indicated by the presence of a name in the response data), it updates various elements to reflect the user's state (
e.g., displaying the username, showing logout link, and hiding the login link).

##### Theme Management

Users can switch themes by clicking on theme options. The script supports 'main', 'night', 'forest', and 'pony' themes.
The chosen theme is saved to `localStorage` and persisted across sessions.

#### Error Handling

Errors during data fetch operations are logged to the console to aid in debugging.

#### DOM Elements

The script manipulates various DOM elements identified by specific IDs (`modal`, `modal-content`, `theme_style`, etc.)
and classes (`.close`). Ensure these IDs and classes are present in your HTML to avoid script errors.

#### Best Practices

- Ensure all endpoints used with `showModal` are secure and authenticated as needed.
- For accessibility, consider adding ARIA attributes and roles to the modal and ensuring keyboard navigability.

#### Dependencies

This script requires a modern browser with support for ES6 features (e.g., `async/await`, `fetch` API, template
literals) and the DOM `ContentLoaded` event.

## Developer Documentation: HTML Auto-Redirect Page

This document provides an overview and code example for setting up an HTML page that automatically redirects users to a
new page. This technique is useful for redirecting traffic from old URLs to new ones, maintaining user experience during
site restructuring, or simply guiding users directly to a main or updated page.

### Overview

The HTML meta refresh tag is utilized to implement an automatic redirect. This tag instructs the browser to refresh the
page and load a new URL after a specified number of seconds. In this example, the redirection is immediate (0 seconds).

### Code Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <!-- Meta Refresh Tag for Redirect -->
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=/index.html">
</head>
<body>
<!-- Fallback Link -->
<p>If you are not redirected, <a href="/index.html">click here</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Components

- **DOCTYPE Declaration**: `<!DOCTYPE html>` specifies the document type and HTML version. This ensures the browser
  renders the page in standards mode.

- **Head Section**: Contains the meta refresh tag used for redirection.

    - **Meta Refresh Tag**: `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=/index.html">` is placed within the `<head>`
      section. It has two main components:
        - `content="0"`: The number (in seconds) before the page is redirected. `0` makes the redirect instant.
        - `url=/index.html`: Specifies the destination URL. Replace `/index.html` with your target URL.

- **Body Section**: Provides a fallback for users whose browsers do not support meta refresh or have it disabled.

    - **Fallback Link**: A simple message with a hyperlink (`<a href="/index.html">click here</a>`) guiding users to
      manually click if the redirect does not work automatically.

### Usage

1. **Customization**: Replace `/index.html` in both the meta tag and the fallback hyperlink with the path to your new
   page.
2. **Deployment**: Save this code in an HTML file and upload it to your server or hosting environment in place of the
   old page you wish to redirect from.
3. **Testing**: Access the URL of the page where this redirect is set up to ensure it redirects immediately to the new
   page. Verify the fallback link works by disabling meta refresh in your browser settings and accessing the page again.

### Best Practices

- **SEO Considerations**: Frequent use of meta refresh redirects can affect your site's SEO negatively. For permanent
  redirects, a server-side 301 redirect is recommended.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the fallback link is clearly visible and accessible for users who might need it.
- **Testing**: Test the redirect across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and user experience.

### Conclusion

The HTML meta refresh tag offers a simple method for page redirection. While useful for quick fixes or temporary
redirects, consider more SEO-friendly methods for permanent solutions. Always provide a clear fallback option for the
best user experience.

## Developer Documentation

### Overview

This document provides essential information for developers working on a project that involves handling PNG image files,
extracting XMP metadata embedded within them, and potentially modifying or utilizing this metadata for further
processing or analysis.

### PNG File Format

Portable Network Graphics (PNG) is a raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. PNG was
designed for transferring images on the Internet, not for professional-quality print graphics, and therefore does not
support non-RGB color spaces such as CMYK.

#### Structure

A PNG file consists of a PNG signature followed by a series of chunks. A chunk consists of four parts:

1. **Length**: A 4-byte field indicating the number of bytes in the chunk's data field.
2. **Chunk Type**: A 4-byte field defining the type of the chunk.
3. **Chunk Data**: The actual data of the chunk, of length specified by the length field.
4. **CRC**: A 4-byte field used to check for errors in the chunk.

The first chunk after the PNG signature must be the IHDR chunk, which contains basic information about the PNG image
such as width, height, bit depth, and color type.

### XMP Metadata in PNG

Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) is a standard created by Adobe Systems for embedding metadata into digital media. In
PNG files, XMP metadata is stored in an iTXt, tEXt, or zTXt chunk with the keyword 'XML:com.adobe.xmp'.

#### Extracting XMP Metadata

To extract XMP metadata from a PNG file, follow these steps:

1. Read the PNG file and identify iTXt, tEXt, or zTXt chunks.
2. Look for chunks with the keyword 'XML:com.adobe.xmp'.
3. Extract the chunk data, which contains the XMP metadata in XML format.

#### Parsing XMP Metadata

Once you have extracted the XMP metadata, you can parse the XML to read the metadata fields. The metadata can include
information such as the creator, creation date, modification date, and more.

### Modifying XMP Metadata

To modify XMP metadata:

1. Parse the existing XMP metadata from the PNG file.
2. Modify the XML document according to your needs.
3. Encode the modified XML document back into the PNG file, replacing or adding to the existing metadata.

### Example Code

Below is a pseudocode example demonstrating how to extract XMP metadata from a PNG file:

```python
def extract_xmp_metadata(png_file_path):
    with open(png_file_path, 'rb') as file:
        content = file.read()
    
    # Look for the XMP metadata chunk
    start_keyword = b'XML:com.adobe.xmp'
    start_index = content.find(start_keyword)
    
    if start_index == -1:
        return None
    
    # Extract and return the XMP metadata
    metadata_start = start_index + len(start_keyword)
    metadata_end = content.find(b'\x00', metadata_start)
    xmp_metadata = content[metadata_start:metadata_end]
    
    return xmp_metadata


## Example usage
xmp_metadata = extract_xmp_metadata('example.png')
if xmp_metadata:
    print("XMP Metadata found:", xmp_metadata)
else:
    print("No XMP Metadata found.")
```

**Note:** This pseudocode is simplified for clarity and does not handle all aspects of PNG file parsing or XMP
extraction, such as dealing with compressed iTXt chunks or validating chunk CRCs.

### Conclusion

This document outlines the basic approach for handling PNG files and extracting, parsing, and modifying XMP metadata
within them. Developers can use this guide as a starting point for implementing more comprehensive solutions tailored to
their specific project requirements.

# main\resources\welcome\pony.scss

## Developer Documentation: Styling App-Type Elements

This guide provides an overview of the CSS styles applied to elements with the `.app-type` class. These styles are part
of a larger styling framework that may include imports from shared schemes and main stylesheets. Below you will find a
detailed description of each style property used and its impact on the appearance of `.app-type` elements.

### Style Overview

The `.app-type` class is designed to stylize specific text elements within an application, giving them a distinct
appearance that includes uppercase lettering, a specific font size and weight, a background color with transparency,
rounded corners, padding, and a text color set to white.

#### Code Snippet

```css
.app-type {
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-size: 0.6em;
    font-weight: 600;
    background-color: rgba(0, 200, 255, 0.25);
    border-radius: 5px;
    padding: 2px 5px;
    color: white;
}
```

### Style Properties

- `text-transform: uppercase;` - This property transforms all the text of the element to uppercase, making it stand out
  and indicating a specific category or type within the application.

- `font-size: 0.6em;` - Sets the font size to 0.6 times the size of the font applicable to the element's parent, making
  the text smaller and ensuring it doesn't overpower other text or elements nearby.

- `font-weight: 600;` - Applies a font weight of 600, making the text semi-bold. This increases the text's prominence
  without making it as heavy as bold text.

- `background-color: rgba(0, 200, 255, 0.25);` - Specifies a background color using the RGBA color model. This color is
  a light shade of cyan with a 25% opacity, allowing for the background behind the text to be partially visible, adding
  depth to the design.

- `border-radius: 5px;` - Rounds the corners of the element's background with a radius of 5px, softening the overall
  look and making it more visually appealing.

- `padding: 2px 5px;` - Adds padding inside the element, with 2px on the top and bottom, and 5px on the left and right.
  This creates space around the text, making it more readable and aesthetically pleasing.

- `color: white;` - Sets the text color to white, ensuring high contrast against the semi-transparent cyan background
  for better readability.

### Usage

To apply these styles, add the `class="app-type"` attribute to any HTML element that you want to stylize accordingly.
Typically, this class is used for small, categorizing text elements within larger applications to denote different
sections or functionalities.

#### Example

```html
<span class="app-type">Free Version</span>
```

This will render the text "Free Version" with all the styles specified under the `.app-type` class, distinguishing it
from other text elements on the page.

### Conclusion

The `.app-type` class provides a set of predefined styles aimed at enhancing the visual hierarchy and readability of
specific types of text within an application. By following the guidelines outlined in this document, developers can
ensure consistent and effective application of these styles across different parts of their projects.

# main\resources\welcome\night.scss

### Documentation for App Type Styles

This section of the stylesheet is dedicated to defining the appearance of elements assigned with the `.app-type` class.
This class is tailored to modify textual elements, giving them a distinctive look that aids in their identification or
emphasis within the application. Below is a detailed breakdown of the `.app-type` class and its properties:

#### Import Statements

```css
@import '../shared/schemes/night';
@import '../shared/main';
```

Before defining the `.app-type` styles, the stylesheet imports two external files. These imports likely contain
variables, mixins, or foundational styles that are necessary for the `.app-type` class to align with the overall design
system of the application.

- **`../shared/schemes/night`**: This import suggests that the `.app-type` class is part of a theme or scheme, possibly
  tailored for a night or dark mode appearance.
- **`../shared/main`**: This import likely contains global styles, variables, and mixins used throughout the
  application, ensuring consistency in design.

#### `.app-type` Class Properties

```css
.app-type {
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-size: 0.6em;
    font-weight: 600;
    background-color: rgba(0, 200, 255, 0.25);
    border-radius: 5px;
    padding: 2px 5px;
    color: white;
}
```

- **`text-transform: uppercase;`**: Converts the text of the element to uppercase, making it stand out and improving
  readability or emphasis.

- **`font-size: 0.6em;`**: Sets the font size to 0.6 times the size of the font of its parent element. This relative
  size ensures that the `.app-type` elements scale appropriately with their context.

- **`font-weight: 600;`**: Applies a font weight of 600, making the text semi-bold. This increases the text's prominence
  without making it overly bold.

- **`background-color: rgba(0, 200, 255, 0.25);`**: Assigns a semi-transparent light blue background color to the
  element. The use of RGBA color allows for transparency, letting the element's background blend with its surroundings
  while still maintaining a distinct appearance.

- **`border-radius: 5px;`**: Rounds the corners of the element with a radius of 5 pixels, softening its appearance and
  making it more visually appealing.

- **`padding: 2px 5px;`**: Adds padding inside the element, with 2 pixels on the top and bottom and 5 pixels on the
  sides. This creates space around the content, making it more legible and aesthetically pleasing.

- **`color: white;`**: Sets the text color to white, ensuring high contrast against the semi-transparent light blue
  background, which aids in readability.

#### Usage

To apply these styles, add the `.app-type` class to the desired HTML elements. This class is primarily intended for
textual elements that require emphasis or a distinctive appearance to stand out from other content. For example:

```html
<span class="app-type">Sample Text</span>
```

## ActorTestAppServer Documentation

The `ActorTestAppServer` is a component of the SimiaCryptus Skyenet web application framework, designed to facilitate
the testing of various actor implementations within a web server context. This document provides an overview of its
functionality, setup, and usage.

### Overview

`ActorTestAppServer` extends the `ApplicationDirectory` class, setting up a web server environment on port `8082` by
default. It is primarily used for testing different types of actors,
including `SimpleActor`, `ParsedActor`, `ImageActor`, and various coding actors (`CodingActor`) with support for Scala,
Kotlin, and Groovy interpreters.

#### Key Components

- **TestJokeDataStructure**: A data class for storing joke structure including setup, punchline, and type.
- **JokeParser**: An interface extending `Function<String, TestJokeDataStructure>`, designed for parsing jokes.
- **childWebApps**: A lazy-initialized list of `ChildWebApp` instances, each corresponding to a specific test
  application for different actor types.
- **toolServlet**: A property returning `null`, indicating no specific tool servlet is used in this application.

#### Actors and Test Applications

- **SimpleActorTestApp**: Tests `SimpleActor` capabilities, such as translating user requests into Pig Latin.
- **ParsedActorTestApp**: Utilizes `ParsedActor` with a `JokeParser` for telling jokes.

### Developer Documentation: App Type Styles

This section of the stylesheet is dedicated to defining the appearance of elements classified under the `.app-type`
class. The style rules specified here aim to create a distinctive look for these elements, making them stand out within
the application's interface. Below is a detailed breakdown of the `.app-type` class and its properties:

#### Import Statements

Before defining the `.app-type` styles, the stylesheet imports two other files:

1. **Normal Schemes**: `@import '../shared/schemes/normal';`
    - This import statement includes the normal color schemes and potentially other shared style properties used across
      the application. It ensures consistency in the visual design.

2. **Main Shared Styles**: `@import '../shared/main';`
    - This import includes the main shared styles that could consist of common typography, layout, or utility classes
      that are reused throughout the application.

#### `.app-type` Class

The `.app-type` class is designed to be applied to textual elements within the application that require emphasis or
differentiation from other text types. The styling attributes are as follows:

- **Text Transformation**: `text-transform: uppercase;`
    - Converts the text to uppercase for a more standout and uniform appearance.

- **Font Size**: `font-size: 0.6em;`
    - Sets the font size to 0.6 times the size of the font of the element's parent, making the text relatively smaller
      and suitable for labels or tags.

- **Font Weight**: `font-weight: 600;`
    - Applies a font weight of 600, making the text semi-bold. This enhances readability and draws attention.

- **Background Color**: `background-color: rgba(0, 200, 255, 0.25);`
    - Sets a semi-transparent background color using RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) values. The color is a light shade
      of blue with 25% opacity, providing a subtle highlight without overwhelming the text color.

- **Border Radius**: `border-radius: 5px;`
    - Applies rounded corners with a radius of 5 pixels to the element, softening its appearance and making it more
      visually appealing.

- **Padding**: `padding: 2px 5px;`
    - Adds padding inside the element, with 2 pixels on the top and bottom and 5 pixels on the left and right. This
      creates space around the text, improving legibility and aesthetics.

- **Color**: `color: white;`
    - Sets the text color to white, ensuring high contrast against the semi-transparent blue background for optimal
      readability.

#### Usage

To apply these styles, add the `class="app-type"` attribute to the desired HTML element. Example:

```html
<span class="app-type">Free</span>
```

This will render the text "FREE" in uppercase, with a semi-bold font weight, smaller size, white color, and a light blue
background, enclosed within a box with rounded corners and padding for spacing.

#### Conclusion

The `.app-type` class provides a standardized way to highlight specific types of information within the application,
making them easily recognizable to users. By combining text transformations, color, and spacing, it creates a visually
appealing element that can be used across various parts of the interface.

# test\resources\logback.xml

## Logback Configuration Documentation

This document explains the structure and settings of a Logback XML configuration file used for logging in Java
applications. The provided XML configuration snippet specifies how log messages are formatted and where they are
outputted.

### Overview

Logback is a widely used logging framework in Java, offering a powerful mechanism for capturing and managing application
logs. The configuration file (`logback.xml` or `logback-test.xml`) is where you define the behavior of the logging
system, such as log levels, output formats, and destinations (console, files, etc.).

### Configuration Elements

#### `<configuration>`

The root element of the Logback configuration file. All configuration properties and appender definitions are nested
within this element.

#### Appender Configuration

Appenders are responsible for delivering log events to their destination. This configuration defines a console appender
named `STDOUT`.

##### `<appender>`

- `name`: A unique name for the appender, `STDOUT` in this case.
- `class`: The fully qualified name of the appender class. `ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender` is used here, meaning
  logs will be written to the console.

###### `<encoder>`

Encoders format log events before they are written to their destination.

- `<pattern>`: Defines the format of the log message. The pattern provided here includes:
    - `%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS}`: Timestamp in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
    - `[%thread]`: Name of the thread that generated the log event.
    - `%-5level`: Log level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO) padded to 5 characters.
    - `%logger{36}`: Name of the logger, truncated or padded to 36 characters.
    - `- %msg%n`: The log message followed by a new line.

#### Root Logger Configuration

The root logger is the parent of all other loggers in the application, and it captures log messages from all levels
unless configured otherwise.

##### `<root>`

- `level`: The minimum level of messages that will be logged. Setting this to `debug` means that DEBUG, INFO, WARN,
  ERROR, and TRACE level messages will be logged.
- `<appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />`: This element links the root logger to the `STDOUT` appender, indicating that log
  messages accepted by the root logger should be outputted to the console as defined by the `STDOUT` appender.

### Conclusion

This Logback configuration provides a basic setup for console logging in a Java application. By adjusting the appender
configurations, log patterns, and log levels, developers can customize the logging behavior to suit their needs. This
setup is particularly useful for development environments where immediate feedback in the console is valuable for
troubleshooting and debugging.

#### Developer Documentation: Decoding and Understanding Encrypted Data

This documentation provides an overview and guide on how to decode and understand an encrypted data string. The provided
encrypted data is a complex string that requires a specific methodology to decode and interpret correctly. This document
is intended for developers who need to work with and understand encrypted data within their applications.

##### Overview

Encrypted data is used to secure information so that it is not accessible or readable by unauthorized users. The example
provided is an encrypted string that likely contains sensitive information. Decoding this data requires knowledge of the
encryption method used and access to the necessary decryption keys or tokens.

##### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with encryption and decryption concepts.
- Access to the decryption keys or tokens.
- Knowledge of the encryption algorithm used (e.g., AES, RSA).
- Required libraries or tools installed for decryption.

##### Decryption Process

The decryption process involves several steps, which are outlined below. Please note that the specific steps may vary
depending on the encryption algorithm and tools used.

1. **Identify the Encryption Algorithm**: Determine the encryption algorithm used for encrypting the data. This
   information is crucial for selecting the correct decryption tool or library.

2. **Access Decryption Keys/Tokens**: Ensure you have access to the necessary decryption keys or tokens. These keys are
   essential for decrypting the data successfully.

3. **Prepare the Environment**: Set up your development environment with the necessary decryption libraries or tools.
   For example, if the encryption algorithm is AES, ensure that you have an AES decryption library available.

4. **Decode the Encrypted String**: Use the decryption tool or library to decode the encrypted string. This step
   typically involves passing the encrypted data and the decryption key to the decryption function provided by the
   library.

   ```python
   from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

   # Example decryption code
   def decrypt_message(encrypted_message, key):
       f = Fernet(key)
       decrypted_message = f.decrypt(encrypted_message)
       return decrypted_message.decode()

   # Replace 'encrypted_data' and 'decryption_key' with the actual data and key
   decrypted_data = decrypt_message(encrypted_data, decryption_key)
   print("Decrypted message:", decrypted_data)
   ```

5. **Interpret the Decoded Data**: Once the data is decrypted, you will need to interpret or parse it based on its
   format (e.g., JSON, XML) and the structure of the information it contains.

6. **Implement Security Measures**: Ensure that the decrypted information is handled securely. Avoid logging sensitive
   information or exposing it to unauthorized users.

##### Best Practices

- **Key Management**: Securely manage decryption keys. Limit access to these keys to only those who absolutely need it.
- **Use Secure Channels**: When transmitting sensitive information, even in its encrypted form, always use secure
  channels (e.g., HTTPS).
- **Stay Updated**: Encryption algorithms and best practices evolve. Stay updated on the latest security advisories and
  update your encryption methods accordingly.

##### Conclusion

Working with encrypted data requires a thorough understanding of encryption algorithms, access to decryption keys, and
the use of appropriate tools or libraries. By following the steps outlined in this documentation, developers can decode
and understand encrypted data securely and effectively.

# test\kotlin\com\simiacryptus\skyenet\webui\TestOpenAPITool.kt

### Developer Documentation: OpenAPI Tool Testing with JUnit

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how to test OpenAPI Tool generation within a JUnit test
environment. The example code demonstrates how to generate OpenAPI client code in Java by using the OpenAPI Generator
tool programmatically within a test case.

#### Overview

The test case `TestOpenAPITool` is part of a larger project aimed at testing the functionality of the OpenAPI Generator
tool. The test involves creating a temporary OpenAPI specification file and using the OpenAPI Generator tool to generate
client code based on this specification.

#### Pre-requisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- OpenAPI Generator CLI installed or accessible via project dependencies.
- JUnit 5 test framework set up in the project.

#### Test Case: `TestOpenAPITool`

##### Step 1: Creating a Temporary OpenAPI Specification File

The test begins by creating a temporary file to store an OpenAPI specification. This specification defines a simple
API, "Gmail Labels API", which includes an endpoint for fetching Gmail labels.

```java
val tempFile = File.createTempFile("openapi", ".json").apply {

writeText(
    """
    {
      "openapi" : "3.0.0",
      ...
    }
    """.trimIndent()
  )

deleteOnExit()
}
```

This temporary file is set to be deleted when the JVM exits to ensure no residual files are left.

##### Step 2: Generating Client Code

The main part of the test involves invoking the OpenAPI Generator tool programmatically to generate client code based on
the temporary OpenAPI specification file created in Step 1.

```java
try{
val generator = "java"

File("C:/Users/andre/Downloads/openapi/build/openapi-$generator").

mkdirs()
  org.openapitools.codegen.OpenAPIGenerator.

main(
        arrayOf(
        "generate",
      "--skip-validate-spec",
                "-i","C:/Users/andre/Downloads/openapi.yaml",
                "-g",generator,
      "-o","C:/Users/andre/Downloads/openapi/build/openapi-$generator",
)
  )
          }catch(e:SpecValidationException){
        e.

printStackTrace()
}
```

In this snippet:

- A target directory for the generated code is created.
- The `OpenAPIGenerator.main` method is called with arguments to generate the client code. The arguments specify the
  input file (`-i`), the generator type (`-g`, in this case, `java`), and the output directory (`-o`).
- The `--skip-validate-spec` option is used to skip OpenAPI specification validation. This can be useful for testing or
  development purposes but should be used with caution.

##### Step 3: Handling Exceptions

The code generation process is wrapped in a try-catch block to handle `SpecValidationException`, which is thrown if the
OpenAPI specification is invalid. In a real-world scenario, additional exception handling might be necessary depending
on the requirements.

```java
}catch(e:SpecValidationException){
        e.

printStackTrace()
}
```

#### Conclusion

This documentation outlines the steps to create a JUnit test case for generating client code using the OpenAPI Generator
tool. It demonstrates creating a temporary OpenAPI specification file, invoking the OpenAPI Generator programmatically,
and handling exceptions.

This approach can be adapted and extended to test various OpenAPI specifications and generator configurations within a
continuous integration pipeline or a development workflow.

# test\resources\permissions\execute.txt

To create comprehensive developer documentation for a given piece of code, it's essential to break down the
documentation process into several key components. These components typically include an overview of the functionality,
prerequisites for using the code, a detailed explanation of the code's workings, examples of use cases, and any
additional notes or warnings that might be relevant. Below is a structured approach to documenting a hypothetical piece
of code:

#### Overview

The `calculateInterest` function is designed to calculate the interest accrued on a principal amount over a specified
period at a given interest rate. This function is useful for financial applications, banking software, and personal
finance tools where interest calculation is required.

#### Prerequisites

Before using the `calculateInterest` function, ensure that the following conditions are met:

- The programming environment supports JavaScript ES6 or later, as the function uses ES6 syntax.
- Basic understanding of interest calculation principles.

#### Function Signature

```javascript
function calculateInterest(principal, annualRate, timeInYears, compoundFrequency = 1) {
    // Function body
}
```

#### Parameters

- `principal` (Number): The initial amount of money on which the interest is calculated.
- `annualRate` (Number): The annual interest rate, expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
- `timeInYears` (Number): The time period in years over which the interest is calculated.
- `compoundFrequency` (Number, optional): The number of times the interest is compounded per year. Defaults to 1 (simple
  interest).

#### Returns

- (Number): The amount of interest accrued over the specified period.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
// Calculating simple interest
const simpleInterest = calculateInterest(1000, 0.05, 1);
console.log(simpleInterest); // Output: 50

// Calculating compound interest
const compoundInterest = calculateInterest(1000, 0.05, 1, 12);
console.log(compoundInterest); // Output will vary based on the compound frequency
```

#### Detailed Explanation

The `calculateInterest` function calculates the interest by first determining if the interest is simple or compounded.
For simple interest (when `compoundFrequency` is 1), the formula used is:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

For compound interest, the formula applied is:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{Rate}}{\text{Compound Frequency}}\right)
^{\text{Compound Frequency} \times \text{Time}} - \text{Principal} \]

The function then returns the calculated interest, excluding the principal amount.

#### Notes and Warnings

- Ensure that all numerical inputs are positive values to avoid unexpected results.
- The function does not validate input types; it assumes all inputs are of the correct type and format.
- The compound interest calculation assumes that compounding occurs uniformly over the specified time period.

#### Conclusion

The `calculateInterest` function is a versatile tool for calculating both simple and compound interest. By adjusting the
parameters, users can tailor the function to suit various financial scenarios. This documentation should provide all the
necessary information to understand and utilize the function effectively in your projects.

# test\resources\permissions\admin.txt

Certainly! To create effective developer documentation for a given code example, it's essential to cover several key
aspects, including an overview of the functionality, prerequisites, how to set up the environment, a step-by-step guide
on how to use the code, and any additional notes that might help the developer understand the nuances of the code. Let's
proceed with an example code snippet you might want to document.

For demonstration purposes, let's assume the code snippet is a simple Python function that calculates and returns the
factorial of a number using recursion:

```python
def factorial(n):
    """Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the number.
    """
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

#### Developer Documentation for Factorial Function

##### Overview

This document provides details on the `factorial` function, a Python implementation that calculates the factorial of a
given number using recursion. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to
the number. It is denoted by n! and is defined for all positive integers and zero.

##### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on the system.

##### Environment Setup

No additional environment setup is required for this function, as it uses Python's standard library.

##### Using the Code

1. **Import the Function**: First, ensure that the `factorial` function is accessible by your script. If it's defined in
   a separate module, you'll need to import it.

2. **Call the Function**: Use the function by passing an integer value to it. For example, `factorial(5)` will calculate
   the factorial of 5.

```python
result = factorial(5)
print(f"The factorial of 5 is {result}")
```

This will output:

```
The factorial of 5 is 120
```

##### Notes

- The function uses recursion to calculate the factorial. This means it calls itself with a decremented value of `n`
  until `n` equals 1, at which point it returns 1.
- Ensure that the input is a positive integer, as the factorial is not defined for negative numbers, and the function
  does not handle non-integer inputs or zero.
- The maximum value of `n` that can be handled is limited by Python's recursion depth limit, which can be checked or set
  using `sys.getrecursionlimit()` and `sys.setrecursionlimit(limit)` respectively.

##### Conclusion

The `factorial` function provides a straightforward and efficient method to calculate the factorial of a number using
recursion. It is a fundamental example of both recursion and the calculation of a mathematical series in computer
science.
