2. Reducing code duplication
3. Enhancing modularity
4. Applying design patterns where appropriate
5. Improving naming conventions
6. Simplifying complex logic

Provide detailed explanations for each suggested refactoring, including:
- The reason for the refactoring
- The expected benefits
- Any potential trade-offs or considerations

Format the response as a markdown document with appropriate headings and code snippets.
