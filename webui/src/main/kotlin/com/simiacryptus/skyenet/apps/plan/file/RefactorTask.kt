1. Improving code organization
2. Reducing code duplication
3. Enhancing modularity
4. Applying design patterns where appropriate
5. Improving naming conventions
6. Simplifying complex logic

Provide detailed explanations for each suggested refactoring, including:
- The reason for the refactoring
- The expected benefits
- Any potential trade-offs or considerations

Format the response as a markdown document with appropriate headings and code snippets.
Use diff format to show the proposed changes clearly.
