### Common Characteristics

All interpreter modules share the following characteristics:

1. They implement the `Interpreter` interface, ensuring a consistent API across different language interpreters.
2. They support the addition of predefined variables, allowing for context to be passed into the executed code.
3. They provide methods for running code, validating syntax, and retrieving language-specific information.
4. They include error handling mechanisms to catch and report execution or compilation errors.

### Integration with SkyeNet

These interpreter modules play a crucial role in SkyeNet's multi-language support feature. They allow the AI-powered system to:

1. Execute code snippets in different languages as part of task processing.
2. Validate code syntax before execution, enhancing error handling and user feedback.
3. Integrate language-specific features and libraries into the SkyeNet workflow.

By providing a unified interface through the `Interpreter` interface, SkyeNet can seamlessly work with multiple programming languages, expanding its capabilities and flexibility in
handling diverse coding tasks and applications.
