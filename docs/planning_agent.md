## **Introduction**

The **Plan** feature is a sophisticated system designed to break down high-level user requests into manageable,
actionable tasks. It leverages OpenAI's capabilities to automate task planning, execution, and management, ensuring
efficient workflow and seamless integration with existing systems.

---

## **Features Overview**

* **Dynamic Task Breakdown:** Automatically decompose user requests into smaller tasks with defined dependencies.
* **Task Execution:** Execute tasks such as code modifications, running shell commands, conducting code reviews, and
  more.
* **Dependency Management:** Visualize and manage task dependencies using Mermaid diagrams.
* **Asynchronous Processing:** Execute tasks concurrently where possible, respecting dependencies to optimize
  performance.
* **Customizable Settings:** Tailor the planning and execution process through configurable settings.
* **Extensible Architecture:** Easily add new task types and extend existing functionalities to fit unique requirements.

---

## **User Guide**

### **Accessing the Plan Feature**

To utilize the Plan feature, navigate to the application interface where task planning and management functionalities
are exposed. This could be within a web UI or another integrated platform provided by your organization.

### **Creating and Managing Plans**

1. **Initiate a New Plan:**

* Enter your high-level request or goal into the provided input field.
* For example: "Set up a new React project with TypeScript and implement authentication."

2. **Task Breakdown:**

* The system will analyze your request and automatically generate a list of actionable tasks.
* Each task will include details such as task type, description, dependencies, input files, and output files.

3. **Review Generated Tasks:**

* Examine the generated tasks to ensure they align with your expectations.
* Modify or adjust tasks if necessary through the interface (if supported).

4. **Execute the Plan:**

* Start the execution process, which will carry out each task based on the defined dependencies.
* Monitor the progress through real-time updates and logs.

### **Understanding Task Dependencies**

* **Visual Representation:**
    * The Plan feature utilizes Mermaid to render task dependency graphs.
    * Access the "Task Dependency Graph" section to visualize how tasks interrelate.

* **Interpreting the Graph:**
    * Nodes represent individual tasks.
    * Arrows indicate dependencies; a task will only execute after its dependent tasks are completed.
    * Styles (e.g., color-coding) indicate the state of each task (Pending, In Progress, Completed).

### **Viewing Execution Logs**

* **Accessing Logs:**
    * Execution logs are automatically generated and can be accessed through the UI.
    * Logs provide detailed information about each task's execution, including API interactions and any errors
      encountered.

* **Log Files:**
    * Logs are stored in the `.logs` directory within your working directory.
    * Each task execution generates a unique log file for traceability.

2. **PlanSettings:** Configures settings related to task execution, such as models, command environments, and
   task-specific configurations.
3. **PlanCoordinator:** Manages the execution of tasks, handling dependencies, threading, and interaction with external
   APIs.
4. **PlanUtil:** Contains utility functions for rendering, filtering, and managing task plans.
5. **PlanningTask:** Represents individual planning tasks and manages their execution logic.
6. **AbstractTask:** A base class for all tasks, providing common functionality and state management.

      val taskSettings: MutableMap<TaskType, TaskSettings> = TaskType.values().associateWith { taskType ->
          TaskSettings(
              when (taskType) {
                  TaskType.FileModification, TaskType.Inquiry -> true
                  else -> false
              }
          )

* **Error Propagation:**
    * Implement mechanisms to handle exceptions in asynchronous tasks gracefully.

### **Customizing Task Execution**

Developers can customize how individual tasks execute by:

1. **Overriding the `run` Method:**

* Implement specific logic for new or existing tasks by overriding the `run` method in task classes.

2. **Integrating with External Systems:**

* Extend task execution to interact with databases, APIs, or other services as required.

3. **Enhancing the Execution Flow:**

* Modify the execution flow in `PlanCoordinator` to support complex scenarios or additional dependencies.

## **Best Practices**

* **Modular Design:**
    * Keep task implementations modular to facilitate easy maintenance and extension.

* **Robust Error Handling:**
    * Implement comprehensive error handling within tasks to ensure the system remains stable.

* **Efficient Dependency Management:**
    * Clearly define task dependencies to avoid circular dependencies and ensure smooth execution.

* **Logging and Monitoring:**
    * Maintain detailed logs for all task executions to aid in monitoring and troubleshooting.

* **Security Considerations:**
    * Ensure that executing shell commands or modifying files does not introduce security vulnerabilities.

## **Troubleshooting**

1. **Circular Dependency Detected:**

* **Issue:** The system throws a "Circular dependency detected in task breakdown" error.
* **Solution:** Review the task definitions to ensure that dependencies are acyclic. Modify task dependencies to
  eliminate cycles.

2. **Unknown Task Type Error:**

* **Issue:** An error stating "Unknown task type" is encountered.
* **Solution:** Ensure that all custom task types are properly defined and registered in `TaskType.kt`.

3. **API Errors:**

* **Issue:** Failures in API interactions during task execution.
* **Solution:** Check API credentials, network connectivity, and API service status. Review logs for detailed error
  messages.

4. **File Reading Errors:**

* **Issue:** Errors while reading input or output files.
* **Solution:** Verify file paths, permissions, and the existence of the specified files.

5. **Task Execution Failures:**

* **Issue:** Individual tasks fail during execution.
* **Solution:** Examine the logs associated with the failed task for error details. Ensure that task configurations are
  correct and dependencies are met.

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

**Q1: How do I enable or disable specific task types?**

* **A:** Modify the `taskSettings` in `PlanSettings.kt` by setting the `enabled` property for each `TaskType`.

**Q2: Can I add custom commands for shell tasks?**

* **A:** Yes. When defining a new task type or configuring existing ones, specify the custom commands in the
  `ExecutionTask` data class.

**Q3: How are task dependencies managed?**

* **A:** Dependencies are defined in the `task_dependencies` field of each `PlanTask`. The system ensures that dependent
  tasks execute only after their dependencies have been completed.

**Q4: Is it possible to log API interactions for auditing purposes?**

* **A:** Yes. The `PlanCoordinator` creates log files for each API interaction, stored in the `.logs` directory.

**Q5: How can I visualize the task execution flow?**

* **A:** The Plan feature generates Mermaid diagrams that visually represent task dependencies and execution flow,
  accessible within the application interface.
