## DiffMatchPatch

### Description

The `DiffMatchPatch` class provides methods to compute the differences between two texts, create patches from these
differences, and apply patches to texts. It is based on Google's diff-match-patch algorithm.

### Key Features

- **Diff Computation**: Computes differences between two texts.
- **Patch Creation**: Creates patches from the computed differences.
- **Patch Application**: Applies patches to texts, allowing for errors.
- **Efficiency and Semantic Cleanup**: Cleans up diffs to reduce the number of edits and eliminate trivial equalities.

### Technical Summary

- **diff_main**: Main method to compute differences between two texts.
- **diff_compute**: Core method that handles the actual diff computation.
- **diff_lineMode**: Performs a quick line-level diff for faster results.
- **diff_bisect**: Uses the Myers' O(ND) algorithm to find the 'middle snake' and split the problem.
- **diff_halfMatch**: Checks if the texts share a substring that is at least half the length of the longer text.
- **diff_cleanupSemantic**: Reduces the number of edits by eliminating semantically trivial equalities.
- **diff_cleanupEfficiency**: Reduces the number of edits by eliminating operationally trivial equalities.
- **patch_make**: Creates patches from the differences.
- **patch_apply**: Applies patches to a given text.
- **patch_addContext**: Increases the context of a patch until it is unique.
- **patch_splitMax**: Splits patches that are longer than the maximum limit of the match algorithm.

### Example Usage

```kotlin
val dmp = DiffMatchPatch()
val diffs = dmp.diff_main("Hello World", "Goodbye World")
val patches = dmp.patch_make(diffs)
val result = dmp.patch_apply(patches, "Hello World")
```

- **Line-by-Line Matching**: Matches lines between the source and patch iteratively.
- **Unique Line Linking**: Links unique lines that match exactly.
- **Adjacent Line Linking**: Links lines that are adjacent to already linked lines.
- **Proximity-Based Matching**: Uses Levenshtein distance and proximity to establish links.

### Technical Summary

- **patch**: Main method to apply a patch to the source text.
- **generatePatchedTextUsingLinks**: Generates the final patched text using established links.
- **linkUniqueMatchingLines**: Links lines between the source and patch that are unique and match exactly.
- **linkAdjacentMatchingLines**: Links lines that are adjacent to already linked lines.
- **linkByLevenshteinDistance**: Establishes links based on Levenshtein distance and proximity to established links.

- **parseLines**: Parses the given text into a list of line records.
- **parsePatchLines**: Parses the patch text into a list of line records, identifying the type of each line (ADD,
  DELETE, CONTEXT).

### Example Usage

```kotlin
val source = "Hello World"
val patch = """
    @@ -1,1 +1,1 @@
    -Hello
    +Goodbye
""".trimIndent()
val result = IterativePatchUtil.patch(source, patch)

- **Deletion Handling**: Skips lines marked for deletion in the patch.

### Technical Summary

- **patch**: Main method to apply a patch to the source text.
- **onDelete**: Handles deletion lines in the patch.
- **onContextLine**: Handles context lines in the patch.

```kotlin
val original = listOf("Hello World")
val modified = listOf("Goodbye World")
val diffs = DiffUtil.generateDiff(original, modified)
val formattedDiff = DiffUtil.formatDiff(diffs)
```

## PatchUtil

### Description

`PatchUtil` is an alias for `IterativePatchUtil`. It provides the same functionality as `IterativePatchUtil`.

### Example Usage

```kotlin
val source = "Hello World"
val patch = """
    @@ -1,1 +1,1 @@
    -Hello
    +Goodbye
""".trimIndent()
val result = PatchUtil.patch(source, patch)
```

## UI Decorators Overview

### 1. `addApplyDiffLinks`

This function adds "Apply Diff" links to code blocks in a markdown response. It processes the response to find diff
blocks and appends links that allow users to apply the diffs to the provided code.

#### Parameters:

- `code: () -> String`: A lambda function that returns the current code as a string.
- `response: String`: The markdown response containing diff blocks.
- `handle: (String) -> Unit`: A function to handle the new code after applying the diff.
- `task: SessionTask`: The current session task.
- `ui: ApplicationInterface`: The UI interface for creating tasks and rendering markdown.

#### Process:

1. **Regex Matching**: Uses a regex pattern to find all diff blocks in the response.
2. **Task Creation**: For each diff block, creates a new task to handle the application of the diff.
3. **Apply Diff**: Adds a link to apply the diff. If the diff is applied successfully, updates the link text to "Diff
   Applied".
4. **Reverse Diff**: If the reverse diff is different, adds an additional link to apply the diff in reverse order.
5. **Verification**: Verifies the applied diff by generating and formatting the diff between the original and patched
   code.

#### Patch Verification:

- **Forward Verification**: Applies the diff and generates a diff between the original and patched code.
- **Reverse Verification**: Applies the diff in reverse order and generates a diff between the original and
  reverse-patched code.
- **Display**: Displays the original diff, forward verification diff, and reverse verification diff in tabs.

### 2. `addApplyFileDiffLinks`

This function adds "Apply Diff" and "Save File" links to file diffs and code blocks in a markdown response. It processes
the response to find headers, diff blocks, and code blocks, and appends links that allow users to apply the diffs or
save the code to files.

#### Parameters:

- `root: Path`: The root path for resolving file paths.
- `code: () -> Map<Path, String>`: A lambda function that returns the current code as a map of file paths to code
  strings.

#### Process:

1. **Regex Matching**: Uses regex patterns to find headers, diff blocks, and code blocks in the response.
2. **Task Creation**: For each diff block, creates a new task to handle the application of the diff.
3. **Apply Diff**: Adds a link to apply the diff. If the diff is applied successfully, updates the link text to "Diff
   Applied".

   to "Saved <filename>".
5. **Verification**: Verifies the applied diff by generating and formatting the diff between the original and patched
   code.

#### Patch Verification:

- **Forward Verification**: Applies the diff and generates a diff between the original and patched code.

blocks and appends links that allow users to save the code to files.

#### Parameters:

- `response: String`: The markdown response containing code blocks.
- `task: SessionTask`: The current session task.
- `ui: ApplicationInterface`: The UI interface for creating tasks and rendering markdown.
- `handle: (Path, String) -> Unit`: A function to handle the new code after saving the file.

#### Process:

   to "Saved <filename>".

## Patch Verification Process

The patch verification process ensures that the applied diff is correct and consistent. It involves the following steps:

1. **Forward Verification**:

- **Apply Diff**: The diff is applied to the original code.
- **Generate Diff**: A diff is generated between the original code and the patched code.
- **Format Diff**: The generated diff is formatted for display.

2. **Reverse Verification**:

- **Apply Reverse Diff**: The diff is applied in reverse order to the reversed original code.
- **Generate Diff**: A diff is generated between the original code and the reverse-patched code.
- **Format Diff**: The generated diff is formatted for display.

3. **Display**:

- **Tabs**: The original diff, forward verification diff, and reverse verification diff are displayed in tabs for easy
  comparison.

4. **Update Verification**:

- **Scheduled Task**: A scheduled task periodically checks if the file content has changed and updates the verification
  diffs accordingly.
