## Architecture and Design

1. **System Architecture:**
    * Overview of the system architecture:
      The Skyenet LLM Agent Platform is designed with a modular architecture to support real-time, interactive applications leveraging large language models. The core components include the LLM manager, session management, and dynamic content rendering. The system leverages LLMs for real-time interaction between the client and server, ensuring low latency and high
      responsiveness. The architecture is divided into several layers: the presentation layer (UI components), the
      application layer (session and task management), and the data layer (storage and retrieval of user data and
      settings).

2. **Design Patterns:**
    * What design patterns are used?
      The Skyenet LLM Agent Platform employs several design patterns to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase:

 **Observer Pattern**: Used in the LLM manager to handle real-time updates and notifications.
 **Factory Pattern**: Utilized for creating instances of various components like session tasks and UI elements.
 **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single instance of core managers like `ApplicationServices`
    - **Observer Pattern**: Used in the WebSocket manager to handle real-time updates and notifications.
    - **Factory Pattern**: Utilized for creating instances of various components like session tasks and UI elements.
    - **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single instance of core managers like `ApplicationServices`
      and `SocketManagerBase`.
 **Strategy Pattern**: Allows for flexible implementation of different retry mechanisms in the `Retryable` class.
 **Decorator Pattern**: Used to extend the functionality of UI components dynamically.
    - **Strategy Pattern**: Allows for flexible implementation of different retry mechanisms in the `Retryable` class.
    - **Decorator Pattern**: Used to extend the functionality of UI components dynamically.

    * Why were they chosen?
      These design patterns were chosen to promote code reusability, flexibility, and separation of concerns. The
      Observer Pattern is ideal for real-time LLM interaction scenarios, while the Factory Pattern simplifies the creation
      of complex objects. The Singleton Pattern ensures efficient resource management, and the Strategy Pattern allows
      for easy customization of retry logic. The Decorator Pattern enables dynamic enhancement of UI components without
      modifying their core functionality.

3. **Technology Stack:**
    * List of technologies and frameworks used:

    - **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Kotlin for the UI components and LLM interactions.
    - **Backend**: Kotlin for server-side logic, leveraging Ktor for building asynchronous servers and managing LLM interactions.
    - **LLMs**: Used for real-time interaction between the client and server.
    - **Database**: HSQLDB for usage tracking, data storage, and managing LLM interactions.
 **Cloud Services**: AWS S3 for file storage, AWS KMS for encryption.
 **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment, Docker for containerization.

## Components and Modules

1. **Component Overview:**
    * **LLMManagerBase**: Manages LLM interactions, message queuing, and broadcasting. It handles the core LLM functionality, ensuring reliable communication between the client and server.
    * **ApplicationInterface**: Provides methods to create interactive HTML elements and manage tasks. It acts as a
      bridge between the task management logic and the LLM communication layer.
    * **SessionTask**: Represents a task that can display progress and messages. It allows for dynamic updates to the UI
      as tasks progress.
    * **TabbedDisplay**: Manages a tabbed interface for displaying content. It supports adding, updating, and rendering
      tabs dynamically.
    * **Retryable**: Extends `TabbedDisplay` to add a retry mechanism for tasks. It allows for re-running a block of
      code and capturing the new output in a new tab.
    * **AgentPatterns**: Provides utility functions for displaying content in tabs. It helps in organizing and rendering
      content efficiently.
    * **Discussable**: Facilitates interactive discussions with users, allowing for feedback and revisions. It manages
      user interactions and refines responses based on feedback.
    * **UserSettingsManager**: Manages user settings, including loading and saving settings to disk. It ensures that
      user preferences are maintained across sessions.
    * **ClientManager**: Manages API clients, including creating and caching clients for sessions and users. It handles
      the lifecycle of API clients and ensures efficient resource usage.
    * **HSQLUsageManager**: Manages usage tracking using an HSQL database. It tracks resource usage and provides
      summaries for monitoring and billing purposes.
    * **AuthorizationManager**: Manages user authorization, checking if a user is authorized for specific operations. It
      enforces access control policies.
    * **AuthenticationManager**: Manages user authentication, including storing and retrieving users based on access
      tokens. It ensures secure access to the system.
    * **DataStorage**: Manages data storage, including storing and retrieving messages, sessions, and other data. It
      provides a persistent storage layer for the application.
    * **AwsPlatform**: Provides integration with AWS services, including S3 for file storage and KMS for encryption. It
      leverages cloud services for scalability and security.

2. **Inter-component Communication:**
    * **LLM Communication**: `LLMManagerBase` handles the LLM interactions and message broadcasting. It
      interacts with `ApplicationInterface` to send and receive messages.
    * **Task Management**: `ApplicationInterface` creates and manages `SessionTask` instances. These tasks
      use `TabbedDisplay` and `Retryable` to display content and handle retries.
    * **User Interaction**: `Discussable` manages user interactions and collects feedback. It works with `SessionTask`
      to update the UI based on user input.
    * **Data Storage and Retrieval**: `DataStorage` handles the storage and retrieval of data. It interacts
      with `UserSettingsManager`, `ClientManager`, and `HSQLUsageManager` to manage user settings, API clients, and
      usage tracking.
    * **Authorization and Authentication**: `AuthorizationManager` and `AuthenticationManager` enforce security
      policies. They interact with other components to ensure secure access and operations.
    * **Cloud Integration**: `AwsPlatform` provides cloud services for storage and encryption. It integrates
      with `DataStorage` and other components to leverage AWS services.
