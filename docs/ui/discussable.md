## Discussable Class Documentation

### Overview

The `Discussable` class in Kotlin is designed to facilitate user interactions within a session-based application,
particularly for tasks that require user confirmation or iterative refinement based on user feedback. It is highly
useful in scenarios where an initial response needs to be generated based on user input, and then potentially revised
multiple times based on further user interactions.

### Key Features

- **Generic Type Support**: The class is generic, allowing it to work with any type of response object.
- **User Interaction**: Manages user interactions and collects feedback to refine the response.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Utilizes semaphores to manage concurrent access to the response object, ensuring thread
  safety.
- **Session Management**: Integrates with session tasks to maintain state across multiple interactions within a user
  session.

### Constructor Parameters

- `task: SessionTask`: The session task associated with the current user interaction.
- `userMessage: String`: The initial message from the user that triggers the response generation.
- `initialResponse: (String) -> T`: A function that generates the initial response based on the user message.
- `outputFn: (T) -> String`: A function that converts the response object into a string for display.
- `ui: ApplicationInterface`: The interface for interacting with the application's user interface.
- `reviseResponse: (List<Pair<String, Role>>) -> T`: A function to revise the response based on a list of user messages
  and their roles.
- `atomicRef: AtomicReference<T> = AtomicReference()`: An atomic reference to hold the response object securely for
  concurrent access.
- `semaphore: Semaphore = Semaphore(0)`: A semaphore to control the release of the response once it is discussed.
- `heading: String`: A heading for the interaction, typically used for display purposes.

### Methods

- `call()`: This is the main method that executes the interaction logic. It orchestrates the display of the initial
  response, handles user feedback, and waits for the user to discuss a final response.
- `main(tabIndex: Int, task: SessionTask)`: Handles the main interaction logic for a specific tab in the user interface.
- `feedbackForm(...)`: Generates a form for user feedback based on the current state of the response.
- `discuss(...)`: Handles the response, releasing the semaphore and setting the response in the atomic
  reference.

### Usage Example

```kotlin
val discussable = com.simiacryptus.skyenet.Discussable(
    task = sessionTask,
    userMessage = "What is the weather like today?",
    initialResponse = { message -> weatherService.getWeather(message) },
    outputFn = { response -> "The weather is ${response.description} with a temperature of ${response.temperature}" },
    ui = applicationInterface,
    reviseResponse = { interactions ->
        weatherService.reviseWeather(interactions.last().first)
    },
    heading = "Weather Inquiry"
)

val finalWeather = discussable.call()
println("Final weather response: $finalWeather")
```

### Notes

- The `Discussable` class is designed to be flexible and reusable for different types of interactions where user
  confirmation is required.
- It uses advanced Kotlin features like generics, lambdas, and concurrency utilities to provide a robust solution for
  interactive applications.
- Proper error handling and user interface management are crucial for implementing a smooth user experience.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `Discussable` class, detailing its construction, methods, and
typical usage within an application that requires interactive user sessions.
